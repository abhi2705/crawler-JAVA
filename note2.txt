-----------------------Reviews --------Thanks to Flipkarts awesome servcice. This phone is huge and even easy to hold. I am 16 and i dont really feel any difficulty while holding this phone. This phone fits perfect in my hand (middle-finger to those who say it doesnt!) This phone sports 4.1.1 JellyBean OS which has a great interface, plus 2GB RAM and 1.6GHz Quad Core Exynos processor makes it one of the fastest Phones (Phablet) in the current market. 8MP Camera, S-Pen and other features makes this phone delightful. My over-all experience was awesome! I am new to android and i must say Android>iOS!! Good Going Samsung! :) One bug in Samsung Galaxy Note II - It keeps on beeping continuously during a call as though there is another incoming call :( .. the worst part is it continues to beep even after the call.... this is so annoying... the only way to get out of this annoying sound is to restart the phone... :( Except this one problem... the phone is ultimate phone... If you are connected to any creative field like fashion ,art , graphic design or if prefer using a pen there couldn't be a better option . I am a petite person with tiny hands and i DON'T find it too big ...its perfect to hold ,looks elegant and does what it says and much more . For me this is the best phone in the world . I preferred over HTC One X - we can attach Micro-SD , Battery can be replaced. I preferred over Galaxy S III - S Pen, real estate , @ GB RAM and Quad Core. Using phone is a breeze to use. Wish to bought from Flip-kart but they do not sell insurance and extended warranty. I had bought this phablet a couple of days ago and i must tell u that it is just fabulous.Previously i had the galaxy note n7000 and i used it for about 8 months but this one is far better than the previous..its as smooth as silk.display is far better although its ppi is lower than note n7000 (267 ppi vs 285 ppi).movie watching is a treat. Gameplay is awesome.everythin is good.it truly makes u feel on top of the world with the most expensive android gadget in today's times!!!! I don't need to mention about specs, its clearly available above...what i really want to share is my experience with S pen, and it was out of the world..I have used so many stylus before but they were more of liability then an asset, in common language, they were pain in the Ass..lol But my experience with this was unbelievable. This is surely the gadget of the year 2012.. Its an excellent phone with very good features overall. Currently best in market. If you use stylus and don't mind the size of the phone, its a definite buy.. BUT.. Galaxy S3 has almost all features sans stylus/pen and size is suitable for all users, so recommended over note 2. Personally I had some issues using the S-Pen and sometimes it will do things i din't want it to. But I guess I just need some tine to get used to it. Using this awesome phbalet from past 3 days..! its just so good... those who r worrying about the size let me tell u... the big screen will just waaoow u.... its so good do daily stuff on the big screen... qwerty typing goes so well on this... on both orientations... there no lag of any sort as the hardware is so good.. screen is so crisp, s-pen works as a charm. Jelly bean is yummm...! n samsung gives the update for multi window muti-task i.e u can do 2 windows at a time like split screen as in NOte 10.1... I am Loving this Phablet... n m preety sure the one who buys is will not regret it in any sort... i must say Bigger the Better...! size is also a plus.. Samsung has done a very good job for the design, they have made full use of the size and don't worry guys its easily pocket-able.. I preferred Titanium grey color... it looks so classy than White..! Go for it guys.. I recently got this Phone + Tablet, quiet amazing in performance, definitely useful for someone who is on the business side. S- Note is much more advance than Note 1, Tech specs are best in the current market. From the looks you might feel that it is elder brother of popular mobile S3 from Samsung. But when you use it, you will know its much better that S3. Comparing with Galaxy Note 1, the size of this one same though the screed slightly larger than it. Much better in everything else. You will love it even more if you love Galaxy Note 1. Overall a must buy for someone who wants find something which can be phone as well as tablet. With a wonderfully vivid 5.5-inch Super AMOLED HD screen and meaty innards, there's no doubt that the Note 2 is the top dog when it comes to raw grunt and function. 2GB RAM.... Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9... Are you kidding me..!!! Add to that the S Pen functionality, which has been given a bunch of new fancy tricks.. would love to buy one..

-----------------------Reviews --------pretty good but galaxy note is far far far better than note 2 it's useless to waste 10000 for note 2,coz it don't give as much facilities in comparison with samsung galaxy note :(//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Device have the features to make you "wow".Bigger screen.latest android OS and other features.you can replace it with your tablet but you can't fit it in your pocket as your cell phone. A device for better visuals and performance but not handy. Samsung Galaxy Note II

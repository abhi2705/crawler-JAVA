After buying this Galaxy Note 2 last week, i had been trying to figure out the extra features that this beast offers in excess to the mentioned above ones. Some of them are as follows: -First of all, the most attractive feature that i really liked was the Motion Sensor Capabilities that this beast is offering. Let me note down some of them as tested by me: 1) To unlock the device with motion, tap and hold a point on the screen, and then tilt the device forwards. 2) When you pick up the device after it has been idle for some time or when the screen has turned off, it vibrates if you have missed calls or new messages. 3) While viewing a call, a message, or contact details on the phone screen, simply pick up and hold the device to your ear to make a call to that number. 4) Tap and hold an item on the screen, and then move the device to the left or right to move the item to another panel on the Home screen or the Applications screen in that direction. 5) When an image is zoomed in, tap and hold a point on the screen, and then move the device in any direction to browse the image. 6) While you are cheking mails or contacts in a page and you reach the middle or the last of the list, simply Double-tap the device to move to the top of a list of contacts or emails. 7) While the screen is locked, tap and hold the screen, and then rotate the device to landscape orientation to launch the camera. 8) Turn over the device(making it lie down with back-side up) to mute ringtone, pause media playback, or mute the FM radio. 9) Shake the device to search for Bluetooth devices. 10) Shake the device to update the list of emails or information from Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance etc. 11) Sweep your hand sideways across the screen from right to left to capture a screenshot. 12) Cover the screen with a palm to pause media playback. Move it away from the screen to resume. 13) Tap and hold two points on the screen, and then tilt the device back and forth to zoom in or out. 14) When the touch screen is turned off, move your hand across the Proximity/Light sensor to turn on the screen lightly and view the number of missed calls and new messages, the battery power level, and more. The above are the special features that this phone provides in respect to various motions. - Secondly, like the Galaxy S3, it has the Smart Stay, which enables the phone to keep the screen on as long as you are looking at it. When you close your eyes or move away from looking into the screen, the Phone screen will automatically turn off. - Thirdly, with the Quad-core processor and 2GB RAM, Gamers will really love this phone since some VERY HIGH RESOLUTION GAMES are just running with not a single point of lag in this phone. - Fourthly, You would luv to watch videos in this phone due to itz big screen and the very good quality videos running smoothly. - Fifthly, Music quality is really very good and descent. Radio works perfect. - Sixthly, SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) Level is relatively low(The lower the Better) for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 in comparision to other phones: Galaxy Note 2: 0.171 W/kg Galaxy Note: 0.39 W/kg Galaxy S3: 0.342 W/kg Galaxy S2: 0.338 W/kg iPhone 4S: 0.98 W/kg iPhone 5: 0.951 W/kg HTC One X: 0.909 W/kg Apart from the above mentioned features: - I have not tested with the camera yet since i already have a Digital Camera. But as read from reviews, the camera is quite good in its capabilities, with 1.9 front camera is just great. - Also not tested with the full capability of the Stylus Pen, since it has loads of functionalities that has to be checked in details :-) So simply after examining withlots of such exciting features, it simply stands out tall in the market.","first flipkart is really awesome and i got my product in 3 days.... now this phone - key features is available in description here is my review after using it .... This is one hell of a gadget,its the best available android phone in market right now.. Screen - The screen is amazing. Even with less pixels and a bigger screen,the sharpness is much higher.Its just so eye popping to look at every time you look at the Raw HD screen of the Galaxy Note II. Its hard to look away for even a moment. And Guess what? Its NOT PEN-TILE!It Decodes DVIX and Xvid movies so watching on this screen is a blast with HD... Battery - as well as desc. The device is run on a mammoth 3100 mAh Li-Ion battery for optimum battery life.its lasted me for around for 20 hours after hard use like playing hd games,internet browsing,playing some hd videos wid full brightness on... Design and feel - Yes its a big phone/tablet but really it feels nice in the hand. I know the device is plastic but it some how have a premium feel to it. It is very uncanny but its beautiful and looks better then the white version IMO(i have a grey one).people who see my phone they said its very beutiful phone,big one but very nice. S pen - This S Pen feels quite better. It's bigger and more comfortable to hold and much more precise/pressure sensitive. It will allow you to do a whole load of new things. Quick pen gestures are great. You draw a custom figure to trigger one action (toggle wifi or bluetooth, look up something in the web, call/text). Taking memos, partial screenshots, scribbling has all become more enjoyable and accurate. Camera - Takes great pictures up to 8 MP and the best I've ever seen on a samsung mobile device, the pictures are just so colorful. The pictures snaps fast and I love it, if you hold the camera button down it snaps up to 20 photos in a second (?) and it has Panorama which I enjoy using. other things - it has 1.6 GHz Quad Core Cortex-A9 Processor and 2 gb ram so it is much much faster then any other android phone right now,it comes wid jelly bean which is smoothest and very good looking android version yet so hardware and software makes this phone incredible.Its a limited amount of apps on the left side of the screen that you can use multi-view with but here is the list: Chrome (Once installed) ChatOn Email Gallery Gmail Internet Maps SNote Messaging You-Tube Video Player Google Talk and now cons - its have some cons like currently - there is no any app in google play for this phone to move application and appdata to external sd card coz samsung change his data manage system on galaxy s3 and note 2,so 16 gb version is not fulfill my req. coz only 11 gb out of 16 gb avail. for use on this phone and big hd games takes up to 1 gb of space...only 1 way to move apps to sd card in currently is rooting this phone but it will ruin its warranty......so wait for a new app It would be great if ALL apps could run under multi-windows mode bcoz several apps is currently we use in multi window feature. At last I love this phone and to be honest with you I don't see myself using another phone for a very long time.It's an awesome phone.As long as having to use two hands sometimes doesn't bother you, get it. grab it asap....","hey guys,i got my beauty 2 days back & believe me i am totally in love with this gorgeous. I was tracking this gadget from the day Samsung announced it in IFA Berlin and watched almost all the reviews, hands-on and unboxing videos on Youtube till date. I am not gonna discuss bout the specs and features but would like to talk on the experience with this phone. I am a tech crazy and would put show off on a second place over the actual things i am going to get after investing hard earned money into the technology. If i am throwing more than 35K, i would try to get maximum out of it and believe many of us want the same as well. First of all please do not compare this device with iPhone 5 as its incomparable. Samsung is on a different path with the performance & features they have included in the phone rather than creating a rival for each and every feature present in iPhone. If you are an existing iPhone user, u'll find a totally different & amazing environment with the openness the Jelly Bean offers to you. The sharpness in the display is tooooo good. Despite of having less ppi you would be able to experience a crisp & stunning display as they have used RGB matrix instead of Pentile in the Note I. The presence of mind Samsung has shown while creating this thing is mind blowing. Each and everything is been done considering how the user is going to face the problem. Despite of big screen its still manageable with one hand. The one handed operations like typing text, using number pad, calculator is very convenient. Other than this i am very much impressed with the voice command all over whether its talking with Google, unlock the screen, playing pause volume up down the song, off the alarm, using the camera...everything will reach above your expectations. Google maps are up to date and incredible. So all and all its a giant surprise package which will reveal when you yourself will use it. Believe me if you have not used this phone, you don't know what actually the technology is. If you are serious about the thing you are looking for & want the worth of the money you are paying....go get it. Let me do a favor by telling this to you that if you can not resist and want to have one very soon before Diwali, do not purchase it from a big showroom or any big mobile store. Instead go to any small retail shop and ask one from them. The reason is some of the retail sellers have direct contact with the distributors and they sell it on very less profit margins. I got it from one of them and encountered the difference of flat 2000k which is a huge amount for me. This money you can invest is buying some good accessories. Hope this review was helpful for you. Thanks and kip smiling :-)","You dont have to think twice about buying this product. Its the fastest and the most powerful phone in the market right now with a fantastic battery for an android device. The only thing one needs to decide is if you want a phone of this size. For me the bigger the better.","My primary requirement was a big screen phone, screen size just enough, about 5.8 inches. To me that is the perfect size for a Phablet. At 5.5 inch this is a slight compromise, but I'll survive. I know there is a 5.9 inch Note 3 coming, but I can't wait that long. Note 2 is a very good phone for people who have a requirement of a Phablet. Pros: Good screen, good camera, stylus, high speed processor, great battery life, very competitive pricing Cons: Poor build quality. Wonder when will Samsung get it right. I am okay to pay a couple of grands more if you get a better build quality. Dear Reva R, Yours was an interesting reivew. This phone is not for everybody. Its for people on the go. For executives, who have a packed day or for people who travel a lot. Its a productivity device, its an entertainment device, its a navigation device, its a life event capturing device, its a note taking device. You say you could buy a HD TV at 36k. You are okay to spend that much on a HD TV but not on a HD mobile. Its like saying that for everybody HDTV is more important than mobile. I am sorry but thats not true. To me, I rarely get to watch TV. A big screen smartphone, was my requirement and at this moment this one is the best available at this price. Thanks, Rohan","Hi Flipkart, you are offering a very great offer by giving 10% off on Standard Chartered credit card after increasing the price of best selling smartphones like samsung galaxy s3, note 2, xperia z... im about to buy note 2 and galaxy s3 by using stan chart credit card, but after this im goin to stop purchasing any thing from FLIPKART... dont cheat us.. stop this gimmick... GUD BYE!!! 5 star for NOTE II... Actual price is 27,500... he he... dnt play FLIPKART....","The one thing a lot of people have against Samsung's Note series is its massive size. So lets just deal with that first and get it over with. Yes, the Note 2 is pretty huge by conventional smartphone standards. It fits in most pockets, but not without its presence being felt. If you aren't comfortable with that, then seriously don't waste anymore time on this page. Now, coming to the good part of the Note 2: * The massive screen with its pleasant 720p resolution makes this an excellent portable movie watcher - don't forget its any-format and any-codec support. * Typing portrait on the Note 2 is truly for the first time in touch phone history a boon. The large screen allows for a comfortable keyboard. * The monstrous 3100 mAh battery will easily last you a day even with heavy usage - and frankly, isn't that the most we expect from today's smartphones? * Again, owing to the screen - web browsing is super fun. * Samsung's customizations run pretty deep in the UI - Nature UX is pleasantly more mature than anime-ish TouchWiz UI. In conclusion, if you're looking for a tablet-ish experience with a phone-ish portability, this lovechild of those two is your next gadget!","I am sure you are reading this review as you are trying to make up your mind if this phone is right for you - just like I was a few weeks back.. The main question that was keeping me from going ahead a making a purchase despite the fact that its got the best all around specs compares to any other model available at this time was - Is it too big? Anyway, I made the choice to go with it and ordered from flipkart at the price lowest compared to other B&M stores. I could tell you how awesome its screen is, or the fact that I watched two movies on it spending less than 50% battery, or any of the other details that you already know about or can find in other reviews/specifications. All I can say is that after using it for a couple of weeks - I don't think I can go back to smaller screens anymore. I am sure you'll be happy with this purchase - so just go ahead. Yes, Its Big! but you'd never go back to tiny screens after using this baby.","I bought the phone today but not from flipkart. Got it at Rs 2000 less than for what it is being sold here right now. The phone is very big, that is the first impression I got. First the average things about the phone: The screen is good, but its like any other flagship phone. Personally i like the screen of my HTC one x a little better. Camera is average for 8 mp,similar to the hox/sgs2. Its made of glossy plastic, i got the metallic grey one. Its a finger print magnet. The good things: It is very very fast, faster than the HTC one x by a fair margin. The s-pen has some cool features, some useful some gimmicky, i dont know if i will be using all them but they are cool to showoff to people. The s-pen is a lot better than the one on the note 1. Used both personally. The difference is there. the screen is big and good for watching movies, its not of the pentile variety, but its not the regular rgbg matrix too. The battery is huge and while i have not had the time to test the phone, it should give good battery life. The bad: there is nothing bad as such about the phone. its size might be one point here, but people with smaller hands should not consider buying this. Glossy plastic might not get too many fans either.","I purchased this phone from local market after exchange, worked so smooth for next 12 days, and suddenly morning of 13th day, its hardware buttons suddenly stopped working, i went to service center and they had a standard reply \"water logging\" problem, and i have to pay them 16000 (half the cost) for a repair set, i plainly declined. Now i did a research on my own and found there is a blue square beneath battery just near the charging points, it that turns RED then it is water problem, otherwise it is not. When i reported this to samsung CEO by mail, i was asked to submit set at very far from home, nehru place, and they will take care of this problem. But they again said the same story (pay half ) But why should anyone pay for their manufacturing defects, so i declined. Now i have submitted my consumer court pre notification letter and they now are calling me for 50% discounts. Now where is their company policy, as i am asking them to pay inconvenience charges of 25 thousand, now they know what it is to pay extra payment for so expensive phones and so they calling me now after so much time the harassed me. But in the end i am going to court and will post what happened in the end. This was just a small description of how these Samsung Service people harass you and are no better than Lava, Micromax, if we talk bad for their services.","Many will give you paragraphs of review and pages of techincal comparison data. Here are some simple things about this proposal for purchase: Behavioural: 1) If you are someone earning less than 75k a month (post tax), then you will end up regretting spending money on a small device (forget capabilities), sooner or later on. I don't fall in this category. 2) If you are a female, it'll slip from your hands often (no offense, you got smaller hands). I'm a male. 3) If you are in the habit of taking out your phone while travelling on bike, please resist buying - it can't take a 4 foot fall on tarmac. 4) If you are past 40, get a blackberry or iphone- this is meant for younger ones who can explore the apps world (Im 29). 5) You cannot go back to smaller screens once you get used to this - it sucks using smaller phones after you use this beast. Usage:Buy this phone if you are in the habit of, with your existing phone, and you would be sure of continuing the following activities even after 2 months of purchase: 1) Watching 1080 movies while travelling 2) Love outdoor photography, and is aware of the fact that all mobile phones suck when it comes to indoor pictures. 3) Use phone extensively for music 4) Install high capacity (>2GB) games like NFS 5) Use viber and whatsapp very frequently 6) Sync google+, gmail etc 7) Find excitement in getting new apps and trying them out 8) Last but not the least, want people to look at you when you hold this in your palm Let me tell you my experience: I do all the activities above: the phones great because 1) Excellent, if not the best display in the industry 2) Good connectivity (call & 3G) at all times 3) Great battery 4) Stylus is amazing, though I didn't detail it above. To spend or not is your call: the industry is in growth phaze, new features will get added and prices will keep dropping....But you can't wait to get the perfect girl when you are 60, Right?","I bought this phone about 7 months ago. I waited so long before I writing this review to make sure that no one is mislead by me. 1. First question that will come to your mind is- 'Is it outdated' My answer is, no. Smartphone market has almost reached a saturation point where there is no further need for better configuration or displays or other features. It runs a quad core A9 processor which is sufficiently fast, has lots of RAM (2 GB) and a HD 720p display. However GPU is in fact outdated but you can still play all the games currently available. 2. Some people say that most Android phones cause problems after about 6 months of usage like lags, freezes, shut downs or sluggishness. It's partially true. Depends on how you handle your device. I have not expected any random shutdowns in 200+ days of usage. It froze two or three times but that was due to applications and not the device itself. It slows down sometimes under heavy usage when I'm about to run out of memory but that happens rarely. Now we get to my experience with the device. 1. Performance- The quad core processor does its job beautifully. Everything is way faster than my previous device. (Sony Xperia Ray) Browsing the web, zooming in or out, using maps, playing games, switching applications everything is lag free. When I compared Asphalt 8 running in my device to a Canvas 4 which is relatively newer device, it was running much smoother. 2. Multitasking- This phone was built for multitasking. It has got 2 GB of RAM out of which you get about 1.75 GB. It is just about impossible to run out of memory unless you try hard to test its capabilities. 45 applications are always open and I opened 35 more that's total of 80 before I reached 90%. of total memory. Also, you get multi-window and pop-up play which can be useful at time. 3. Display, browsing, videos- There is no pixelation and screen looks beautiful even at minimum brightness. It has got deep blacks and saturated colors which I personally prefer. Web browsing experience is just awesome. Page rendering is too good and everything like scrolling, zooming, switching tabs is smooth. You can switch to desktop mode to view a fully functional desktop site. If you browse web a lot or read ebooks, this device is perfect for you. Text is sharp and there is high contrast. Sunlight legibility is good but the display is a bit reflective. Viewing angles are great too. Video player supports every codec and you don't need MX player to do the job. 4. Camera and battery life- Both front and rear cameras have great quality. I was surprised by the front camera, to tell the truth. I am not saying it's the best, but definitely a good one. Video recording is phenomenal and there are bunch of features and modes which I am not interested in but you might be. It has a chunky 3100 mAh battery which lasts two days on moderate usage while others struggle through the day. Here is a sample heavy usage pattern on a sunday- Unplugged at 11 AM, 100% Browsing and whatsapp, down to 80% by 3 PM. Playing moderate and heavy games in the evening. Down to 63% by 6 PM Texting, chatting and browsing, using S-Note, listening to music and calls at night and it's 15% by 3 AM the next day. Finally gave up around 1 PM the next day with screen-on time of 7 hours 15 minutes which is awesome compared to most device which give 4.5 to 5 hours. This is after 7 months of usage which must have affected the battery! 5. Android 4.3- It runs 4.3 buttery smooth after bug fixes (which Samsung released soon enough) which shows how capable this device is. We will get 4.4 in April 2014 according to Samsung. What do you usually look for- Battery, camera, performance, looks, display, user experience. It has got it all, that too for a reasonable price of about 27-28k while current flagships are selling at 10k more, which is a lot. Downsides- 1. No built in flash support although you can run youtube videos right in the webpage which is cool.. 2. Can be difficult to handle sometimes but most of the times, it's fine. Fits in my almost every pocket even front pocket of my jacket. 3. Weighs 183 grams. Most weight is due to the huge battery. 4. Might not be able to run games that will be released after a year or so, smoothly. Still better than 80% of the devices. 5. Takes about 120-150 mins to charge, but if you want great battery life, you gotta compromise. Verdict- You get all that is mentioned above plus the S pen. All features like NFC, USB On The Go which allows you to use a fully functional mouse or pen drive, S features, motion features, voice commands and so on. They are just toppings on what others give at same price. If you are a casual user who uses the web a lot or likes watching movies and videos, playing games, reading etc. and battery life is primary importance, this is the device for you. I wanted something between phones and tablets, so I went with this one and I am one hundred percent satisfied. I don't regret it one bit.","I bought this product on 2nd Feb 2013, and I'm writing this review based only on my personal experience of 1 week of usage, and NOT based on its specifications on paper. First up, the thing that immediately caught my attention was, how beautiful the display is - its absolutely gorgeous! Full HD videos & high def images look great on it! The camera is also really good. I mean, I'm not comparing it with anything (read, iPhone 5, lumia 920, etc); all I'm saying is, one can't be disappointed with the Note 2 for its camera. Besides, I found that low light photos are also very good (again, not comparing with anything); they are more than satisfactorily detailed enough, for me at least - much, much better than the 5 MP shooter on my previous phone (Motorola Defy). The phone has no lag. Be it browsing, gaming, or simply doing the basic functions - none of them showed any sign of lag. AN IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE HERE: A friend of mine has a Galaxy SIII, and after he installed the Jelly Bean update 4.1.1, his phone was laggy. I mean, he complained about it all the time, and I checked that out personally - that phone just lagged in just about anything, sometimes less, sometimes for longer durations. When you held it in your hand, it didn't appear that this phone has a quad core CPU inside! In fact, he told me that he restarts the phone every morning, coz otherwise the laggyness becomes just too much to bare. I simply couldn't understand it - I mean, after all, Jelly Bean is supposed to abolish lag, isn't it? At least, that's what the tech gurus say. Now, one fine day, he call me up & tells me, all excited, that he got the Jelly Bean 4.1.2 update on his phone that day, and he installed it, and the lag has just vanished! He says he doesn't restart his phone anymore. My Note 2 came installed with Jelly Bean 4.1.2 out of the box. But, if anybody is facing issues with the Note 2 (or, with the Galaxy S3 also, for that matter), do check if your phone is running 4.1.1 or 4.1.2 - apparently, it makes a huge difference (it did with my friend at least). Lastly, I'm gonna say to people considering this phone, or people who are confused with what phone to buy if they have a budget upwards of 30k, see what your priorities are. The questions you've got to ask yourself are, do I need a big phone (and thereby a big screen) that allows me to browse pages without zooming in (most of the time), or do I need a more pocketable phone? Do I need a device which gives flawless performance & added functionalities over other phones (read, S Pen), or do I need a lighter phone which is more suited for one hand operation? There are lots of other questions you can form, but I'm sure you get the idea. I knew what I wanted, I researched for a month, I got this phone, and I am happy. As last thoughts, just in case you didn't notice, this is the most high end (1.6 GHz quad core Exynos CPU, 2 GB RAM), and the most expensive android device in the market... Cheers! :)","Products comes and settles and goes away, few makes their marks and few just fades away. No doubt every smartphone you buy today would be feeling like outdated in 6 to 12 months and that's the current trend of mobile industry! But even after this only few products manages to create history and no doubt Galaxy Note 2 is one of them. I am not going to talk about ram, processor specs, benchmarks etc. They are incredible for being future-proof for at least 1.5 years. What I want to talk about is user experience. 5.5\" screen makes it slapping any other device in market. Since I bought this mobile I don't remember when was the last time I switched on my laptop! Android 4.1.1 (waiting for official upgrade to 4.1.2) gives you the best OS this legend could currently have. Touch experience smoother than butter. Yes, Project Butter shows its strength! S Pen is fantastic innovation. You can use it for S Planner, S Memo, S Notes and even for quick commands, clipping etc. More S Pen apps if increases in market will make S Pen to show its full strenght. Optical Character Recognition literally fetches out 99% time correct text for whatever weird your handwriting is. It feels such a wonderful when device with amazing hardware responds with amazing software. Camera interface gives you lot of options to play with but I doubt if one has SLR he/she will never like this camera. But this device's camera is replacement for for most of point n shoot. Overall camera is not great but good with so many options, software tweaks to play with makes it powerful. Device with demon specs has to come with good fuel to support its strenght and Galaxy Note 2's battery is really good and gets you through 1.5 to 2 days of normal usage. Screen color reproduction is outstanding considering the fact the RGB matrix used with 12 subpixels. Most of my pics which shot with DSLR looks great on this device rather than on laptop! Lot of talks are going in market regarding 440ppi etc. Galaxy Note 2 have 275ppi but you have larger screen at the same and this means this device gives perfect combination of sharpness and visible real estate of screen which no other device in current market gives you! Afterall 275ppi depth is more than enough. Music player and sound quality is one of the greatest I have seen long time after Sony's walkman series. Softwares like Music Square are just amazing and it works - allows you to tap squares on grid according to mood and it selectes songs automatically (minimum 25 songs are needed to work this). Now let me talk about few cons of this device : 1) This may not fit your pockets and hands but you will never want to hide it in your pocket! 2) From hardware perspective battery life is good but few software glitches in Android (like running many background processes, caching unwanted applications) makes it hard to utilise battery's full potential. I believe Samsung will fix these with updates in future. Deep Sleep optimisations needs to be optimised more. If you are in poor network area battery just vaporises. 3) Facebook integration is good but not great. Samsung should have build their own Facebook interface instead of relying on standard one. 4) N7100 model does not support LTE. Remember this. LTE model is N7105 and I doubt is it is available in Indian market. 5) Build quality could have been a bit better for device with 37K price. Maybe they could have used some thin steel panel instead of plastic at back. But plastic at back even looks good especially white looks great. About flipkart : Good service. Actually this time it was replacement for me as originally ordered device had display issue. Flipkart needs to improve upon their replacement speed. Afterall nobody just want to pay 37K and sit n wait for new product being available in 6 days. Yes it took 6 days to replace it which is long time. Overall this device is greatest one currently produced by Samsung and will be remembered in history for its innovation and inspiration to new generation of products. Thanks, Mayur Lankeshwar","Just received this masterpiece yesterday. I do not want to retype the specs as most of you are already aware of it. ICS and JB were not new to me since I was using a Galaxy S prior to this and had played around with a lot of custom ICS ROMs. Before placing the order, I was very skeptical to get it as many told me about its humongous size. IMO, size is only relative. If you have been using phones with 3.5-4\" displays you will definitely find it huge. But, the size is justified with the power it packs under the hood and the monster battery that it holds. Believe me, my hands are not big and I was able to use it one handed to make calls. For everything else, you need two hands of course. I was able to fit this into my jeans pocket (without it protruding out) and ride my bike without having to worry about whats in my pocket. I was earlier thinking of going in for the GS3, but trust me you will never regret owning this one for a couple of thousand bucks more. Samsung has hit a masterstroke on this one, quietly though and it scores in every department. Thanks to the 3100mah battery, it has lasted me 23 hours (and still going) though I have completely abused it watching videos, surfing, downloading apps, exploring the S-Pen etc. When you buy this, ensure you buy the original flip cover as well. Trust me, this is good and protects the Note 2. There are however two disadvantages having this monster, one you will lose sleep big time and two, your wife will not like it for the attention it gets. Lastly, the service by flipkart is truly commendable. Ordered on Tuesday late night and received it thursday noon and packaging was flawless as usual.","first of all. i am going to make my point straight forward that I am not comparing this with any other phone like apple's iphone.but as an apple user and fan boy,i will figure out some points. both phones have their own features and class. but if you are a tech savvy who likes to play with technical stuff,i will highly recommend note 2. after using 4s for almost 11 months,today i switched to note 2. apple's software was becoming a piece of crap day by day. specifications: A powerful quad core processor clocked at 1.6 ghz. 2 GB of ram,heavy apps are nomore an issue. super amoled hd screen for crispy and sharp resolution. 8 megapixel camera, its just an above average camera.i clicked a few pictures and believe me,it was just average like 4s.shutter speed is also fast.nothing fascinating but front camera is 1.9 mp which is impressive. jelly bean os is smooth,doesn't lag,though fb app sucks on android,hoping for an update soon. battery back up is also very good. i like to play with S-pen :D jelly bean has everything i was looking for, a blocklist, antispam for sms, a better task switcher, and no more itunes. and UI is awesome. playing games is fun as well. the only issue with this mobile is. it isn't very mobile(if u know what i mean). its a little hard to carry around,listening calls while driving isn't easy(can be sorted out with Bluetooth headset),cant operate with one hand(not really a big issue tbh because of larger screen,its totally worth it). overall review. I liked it. thumbs up if this review helps.","@DC : Dude I am just laughing at your comment over Note 2 and Iphone. Posh, Sophistcated! Hahaha! Iphone 5 doesnt even recognize Indian accent. Check videos available out on internet! And you say it is the best! Note 2 with Awesomely upgraded S voice is the best with many other great features! Spending 40k+ for iphone jus for posh looks and calls and messages....Dont you think you are the most stupid fellow on earth! Its better you buy some 1k phone and do all these stuff.! Note 2 just rocks! It is 1 generation ahead than any other phone in smartphones market","You must be knowing all the specifications or yu can check in other reviews or google them..as its a review section i would like to review my experience... i bought it on 13th october's afternoon..at rs.37,200 (so not from flipkart)..!! See the phone is no doubt fascinating and yu feel good holding it..and the fact is it is really one good phone..its fast ..hd display..colours are better than earlier samsung phones..and almost every feature yu r looking for..its like the mountain top of phones today..there cant be more things which can be bundled into it.. The only drawback which i felt and everyone around me mentioned was its ENORMOUS SIZE!! its really big and it weighs 183 gms..its not for a girls hand ..or men with small hands.. its slim but not comfortable to hold for long..like i was keeping the phone down after around 5 mins..its like yu r holding a ceramic tile .. thirdly talking about the s pen or the stylus its a good add on..as an eg..if yu r talking to some one and need to note down something so as soon yu take out ur stylus ..a note pad pops up..where yu can put down notes.. Fourthly it uses a micro sim so buying from such websites is a viable option only if yu have a micro sim already or can get it punched around ur place.. Finally..talking about the basis of my review .. i previously owned an xperia arc..of my three close friends one owns an htc one x and another s3 and last one the galaxy s2..if yu can hold around 200 gms of weight and make calls then theres nothing like it..else go for s3 or htc one x.or even s2...they r equally good options ..i just deduct a star for its size and weight..","Finally a product to look forward, meeting both Business & Creative needs. Well if you can afford anything, this is the only Phone you need to buy. Pros: 1] 5.5 Inch (Huge) Super HD AMOLED Screen. 2] Ergonomical design to be handled easily (you can use this phone even with 1 hand) 3] S Pen - and it functionalities - ( there are so many shortcuts to number of functionalities, you won't need Home, Back buttons) 4] Smooth - Operations 5] Whopping 2GB of RAM & 16GB inbuilt memory ( you can use 10.75 GB only out of this, but no issues). 6] 3100 mAh Battery - it works almost 1.5 days for me. 7] Great, rather I would say enhanced functionalities than SIII (in it own domain) 8] Best for Business purpose as well as entertainment, Multifunctional usage (this Firmware Upgrade is not confirmed yet). 9] Great Camera Quality & functionalities. 10] Finally, Great user experience. Cons: 1] This Phone needs a MICRO-SIM, beware of having it beforehand. 2] Price range. 3] Need to have a Cover and Screen guard immediately - you don't want to have scratches on your Note II's Screen right ? 3] Accessories are not out in market yet. (not everywhere) Overall I would say this is the best phone ever. Great features, great functionalities. Worth the Price Tag. Go for it! You will never regret it.","I recently purchased a Galaxy Note 2 which had 5% cash back offer. But, I'm yet to get the money back. I have been fighting over the issue from past 1 month and the issue is still not resolved. Was a bad experience shopping with Flipkart.","First Of All This Is For Those Who Don't Even Own A Single Smartphone And They Give Negative Review To The Juggernauts Of Their Field Such As Apple Iphone , Samsung S4 And Note 2 ... You Guys Seriously Need To Go Away .. How Can You Review A Phone Without Using It :/ Now As Far As I'm Concerned With The Review Of This Phone It Can Be Described In One Word Only ...Awesome I Used To Own LG Optimus Black P970 Before This Piece Of Art So This Is My Second Android Phone. I Wanted To Change My Cell So After Months Of Mind Tumbling Research On Net I Was Seriously Confused Between Iphone 5 And Note 2 I Wanted To Go For Iphone 5 But I Didn't Went For It As i Was In The Need Of A Phone With Big Screen So I Made The Final Verdict And Went For Note 2 Though It Was Released 9 Months Ago But It Specs And Performance Can Beat Any Phone In The Market Today ... And This Gamble Worked Perfectly For Me And I'm In Love With it Now Every One Knows About The Specs So I Would't Discuss It Here ... And Most Of The Smartphone Owner Know This Fact That Specs On The Paper Really Doesn't Matter It's About The Performance And Optimization Of The OS And UI That Really Makes A Smartphone 1) Now I've Seen People Saying That It's Too Big To Be Used In Daily Life... I Want To Ask Those People Have You Ever Hold This Phone In You Hand ??? It's Just Perfect After Spending 30-40 k On a Smartphone You Don't Deserve A Small Screen .. You Deserve a Larger Crisp 720P SUPER AMOLED Display In Which You Can Watch Movies And Other Stuff That You Do On Your Lappy Or PC. 2) Now About The Battery \"Big Screen Means More Battery Which Means Less Back Up\" These Were The Words Of My Friend, I Never Buy Any Electronic Without His Approval And This Was The First Time I Listen To My Mind And I'm Proud Of My Decision Note 2 Has The Best Battery Back Up Among All The Smartphones Present In The Market Today Despite Having Larger Display It Gives Me 1-2 Days Back Up On Wi-Fi 3) Now About The Build Quality I Really Admit That Note 2 Can't Be Compared With Iphone And HTC One In Build Quality But Believe You On Me People It Is Not Cheap Plastic as rumoured By People It's Made Up Of Good Poly Carbonate. 4) Overall As You Must Have Read In The Other Review The Performance Of The Phone Is Great There Is No Lag In It I Got 4.1.2 Out Of The Box And 4.2 Is Ready For The Release In August Then It Will Have Most Of The S4 features. 5) When I Bought This I Used To Think That This S Pen I Would't Ever Going To Use But Now I Actually Use This S Pen For Most Of The Operation Of The Phone And Words Just Can't Describe It . You Gotta Use By Yourself 6) The Stock Accessories Is Of Good Quality Except The Ear Phones They Are Just Horrible Zero Bass .. i Own Premium Headphones So It Not A Big Deal For Me But Consider This You Have To Buy New Ear/Head Phones If You Want Good Music Experience But Let Me Clear I'm Not Saying That Only Note 2 Has Bad Earphones Most Of The Stock Earphone Are Of Bad Quality 7) Last But Not The Least I Read In a Review On Flipkart That \"Don't Fall For Smartphone Tactics You Can Buy A.C Fridge Or A Car On EMI \"No Offense To That But Premium Range Smartphone Are Not Made For Common People Why Misguide People, Buy A Phone That Your Budget Allows. But Don't Curse Iphone, Note 2 For Their High Price And Please Don't Compare These Phones with Lava,Xolo,Karbonn,Celkon Etc. Note 2 Is A Benchmark In Smartphone Industry Just Go For It","the samsung galaxy note 2 is a niche device. with its 5.5 inch super amoled screen it is one of the best screens available for a smartphone at the moment! and that too its non pentile. many people are considering buying sony's new flagship the xperia z , it has a full HD 1080p screen but its viewing angles are not that good. a student or a businessman with creative capabilities shud definately go with the note 2 . this is a really awesome device with amazing features! the huge screen on this phone is just lovely for surfing the net and playing games and videos, moreover this phone has a mammoth battery with awesome batterylife. the note 2 has a great camera with zero shutter lag and can snap 2 photos per second! with its quad core processor clocked at 1.6GHz and android jellybean with project butterthis phone can make brains melt with its 2GB of RAM! and it has great camera features too! i can write about this wonderful device for days together! GUYS IF U CAN AFFORD IT THEN DO GO AHEAD WITH THIS PHONE! IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT U!","Recently got this phone and has fallen in love with it. Features I love: 1. Excellent screen (all other phones will start looking dull once you get hold of it) 2. Handwriting recognition.. for any input, I do not even take out S-Pen, just write word with my finger and it recognizes text so well 3. Camera: Burst mode, panorama and many other good features 4. Ability to mark a number as Spam so that all ads go to JUNK 5. Has FM radio (Heard somewhere that it doesn't have .. but it does) 6. Good battery. Even with Wifi whole day, your battery would stay for a day 7. Pocketable.. Yes it is. Even in tightest jeans, it slips down easily being very slim and I do not find any trouble keeping it in pocket with its original cover. Samsung did a very smart decision of reducing width from Note 1 in this one. 8. S-Pen: Often when free, I take S-Pen out and start drawing something (Something I'm absolutely poor in.. :D) Not Cons, but something you may wish to consider: 1. If you have small face, you'd find difficulty in using it 2. For lesser waist tight jeans (say less than 34 inches) you may feel it in pocket. Else you won't even feel its presence once slipped.","Hello people.....first Ill say abt this phone.....Looks Good!!!! ya. U know all the details abt this phone and please dont neglect this bcoz the people who are saying this phone is very big for hands is all a lie! first i thought to buy the phone and by seeing the negative reviews here i changed to galaxy S3...then i went to universel and i saw the dummy of this phone. Fits perfectly in my hands and great design. Every 1 saying that this phone is big that they cant afford this phone. so they are jealous of them who are trying to buy. So they are making us not to buy. Believe me. this phone is AWSM! I am just 15 yrs old and fits perfect. so what do u think?","This is a great device for those who want a do it all device. Have been an Apple fanboy for a very long time but began questioning the need for a device which is expensive and good to look at but simply DID NOT expand the horizon for 2 years now. Here comes Samsung along with Googles brand new Jelly Bean 4.1 (4.2 soon) OS and makes you wonder - \"Gees why can't my iPhone do this...?\"... This is the device along with its inspiration - the Galaxy S3 which push the limits of multi-tasking on a mobile screen... Simply a phenomenal device if you can think beyond the aesthetics and clean interfaces. This is a multitasking powerhouse...","Amazing phone! Brilliant and vibrant display! Even more amazing is the smoothness of the interface and the sound output. Like Samsung portrayed in the IFA unveiling of this phone, the S Pen really does turn into a \"Magic Wand\" when it comes to this device. The browsing speed is really good. Samsung's S Voice sucks and was a duplication of effort since Google Voice is flawless. Jelly Bean really does take Android into a new dimension. Highly recommended!","The phone is really awesome with all its cool features the best one being S note and Multi-Tasking. Other cool features are the Camera and Video Player Functions. The phone is not that big like imagined and can be conveniently handled. I have seen some drop tests on YT and the phone is really a tough one. So guys go ahead and buy the phone its worth the money spent and if purchased online prefer Flipkart. The shipping is always fast and safe at Flipkart. You do not have to worry abt the shipping of such a costly product.","I was using iphone 4 for nearly 2 years... and had got used to the iOS. Galaxy note 2 and all its features attracted me towards it from the first day I saw it. I am using note 2 for 2 days now and m liking it very much... I was thinking that I might miss my iPhone... but its not like that. And the big screen has started to appear normal already. Battery was down to only 50% after a whole days use with internet on the whole day and heavy use of maps and gps as I was travelling.","Phone is Fantabulous,loads of features,added advantage S Pen it just doesn't remain stylus..this one is intelligent ! Future proof? obviously it is ! I am waiting for the price drop...hope flipkart does some favour !","First of all how can Flipkart change the price of the product. What is available at Rs 31500/- in the market in almost all the stores, Flipkart if pricing it at Rs 40000/- plus. and then offering a discount. I would suggest a strategy to Flipkart: Price the product at Rs 100000/- (One Lakh) and then offer a discount of 70%. Flipkart can claim to be the one and only one in the world or the universe to offer the maximum discount to its customers. Keep it up, Flipkart, You have put enough effort to come a position, but it will take very less effort to come to the bottom and then become extinct.","While ordering the phone I was promised that as soon as my old phone would reach back, my new phone would get 5% cash back. But it been nearly a month and no action has been taken. I have contacted Flipcart support multiple times, but the response is slow and the issue is not being resolved.","I have been using this phone since past week and let me admit that the experience has been unbelievable. It is one hell of a dream gadget to own. I will not go into technical specifications as it is already there on many sites and will directly focus on user experience. Let's talk about it's size. For some it might be too big but it's 5.5\" Super Amoled Screen is it's USP. Display is crystal clear and viewing web pages, images and watching movies is a flawless experience. Jelly Bean makes the phone super slick, fast and there is almost no visible lag. Transition of pages is buttery smooth. Syncing of accounts is as easy as it can get, hassle free. Quality of music in earphone is awesome but for that you need to get a good quality headphone. Sound output in loudspeaker is loud and clear. Images captured by the camera is beautiful with plethora of settings and customization options.It is at par with the best out there in the market. You will hardly need your digi cam. Video Recording is equally good. Wi Fi, Blue Tooth, 3G are all amazingly fast. Chrome browser is a treat to use. I have hardly opened my laptop ever since I bought my Note II. S pen has handy productivity features and makes life quite easy. Taking notes, drawing sketches are fun. And what about battery back up? With a 5.5 \" super Amoled Screen you would expect battery to die soon. But surprise!!! Battery back up is mammoth. With single charge phone easily lasted for 18-20 hours while wi fi ws continuously on watching youTube, browsing net, checking mails, listening music. I don't think any phone currently in the market have such a huge battery back up. Galaxy Note II is a pure charm to use. Though it has a few cons but those are virtually negligible.","This is the best smartphone ever had and ever released by Samsung in India. Here are the reasons: 1. Best battery backup, won't drain crazily, will last a day 2. Faster processor with 2GB Ram, won't lag unless lag caused by apps from play store. 3. S Beam, fastest and easiest file transfer between phones 4. best both front and back camera. This camera even beats 20.7 mps Sony's Z2 5. Continuous updates. Received Kitkat recently. It has come cons like: 1. Recent updates are not really made for Note 2. Especially while using Multi Window, it became quite useless due to improper customization for Note 2. 2. Speaker is although loud and good but it is located at back which is a great drawback. Still there is no phone to beat this, S4 and Note 3 came but it's Octa core, in which slow processor lag the phone and high speed processor heats phone and drains battery. Still not a good phone like Note 2 launched in India. BTW S5 is just a joke. People who have money but don't know what to do will buy S5.","I am finally writing a review after being a satisfied user for almost one and a half years. Before I got this phone I was someone who would change his phone very very often.... as often as 2-3 months. Now I realise that was because none of the phones that I used before was as good as this!! I must say that I am a very very heavy user spending hours doing something or the other with this phone, either playing, or working, sending emails, random scribbling, social networking, clicking photos, listening to music etc. Even after one and a half years this beast is still serving me well.... the battery is great, have been receivng software updates, the operating system does not hang up and it is still buttery smooth as it was when I bought it. Sure there are better phones in terms of specs that have come out since the note 2, but in terms of practical usability I still don't find the urge to upgrade it, better processors, higher res. screens, better cameras have come out. But my note 2 is still going strong and I have formed a great attachment with it!! Since now that the phone has come down to around 27-28k I would strongly recommend it to anyone within this budget. It has a great camera, great software, great sound quality, great screen (although 720p) and most importantly a great battery.","Have been using this phone for a month now. First thing first ordered from flipkart on 29th of June and receive it on 30th. Really shocked with the speed of delivery. Ordered a Titanium Grey piece which looked stunning(Color preference is is individuals choice anyway). booted up real quick and let me tell you it has a wonderful screen. when i played my favorite video Alexander Stan's Sexo Beat on this one.. well that is when i really fell in love with this device. Coming to the OS Jelly bean it was like it is designed for this particular device. The interface was soo smooth. Thanks to 2GB RAM. Call quality I would say is the best from all the mobiles I used previously. In fact my dad said you sound so real from this device. And its SAR is the best of Industry. Loudspeaker was ok I have not used much of it. Playing Games on this device is really addictive I played most of the graphic intense games and recently downloaded Iron Man 3 which is butter smooth, the same game when i played it on my friend iphone 4s which was lagging like hell. And on the screen as big as note 2 you can't ask for better. Thanks its Adreno 400 GPU and High clocked 1.6 Quad core processor. Really amazed to that see that this device does not heat up as of other device. All most all the device gets heated up while playing games, charging or browsing net but Note 2 is as cool as cucumber. Really impressed. Speaking of the size of the device, at beginning I felt it a little big and even my mom asked me if it is a tab.. But after few days its perfectly convenient and fits in all my jeans pockets. Battery life is the stand out selling factor of the device. Im a heavy user and there was a time when i thought that no phone can give me more than a half day and used carry a charger to my office regularly, but Note 2 is an Exception, at the end of the day after monstrous use i still had 15% battery left on an average which is awesome. Only two mobiles can perform true multitasking those are none other than Note 2 and recent S4. you can run two different tasks on the same screen at a time using multitasking window. very useful once you experience it. Conclusion: Don't go for S4, HTC One or Iphone 5 to waste of your hard earned money.. upgrade your phone to Note 2 and you will be more than satisfied. The only con I would think of is some applications crash occasionally where you will have to re start the application again, not a deal breaker for me but for some it is. Some where around October it is going to get Key Lime Pie update(as heard from some sources) which will improve its performance to the optimum level).","I am using this phone since last 4 months now, and its amazing, nothing compared to its speed and quality. I specially love its screen size, HD quality and processor speed. More over with jelly bean update of 4.2.2 releasing soon in India for Note 2 its equivalent to Galaxy S4 in tech terms. It has beautiful S pen feature and I will strongly recommend this phone to people looking for smartphones above 30k.","1.Battery backup is very good. 2.Price is reasonable as compared to s4. 3.very good performance. 4.Very good camera..and video recording.. 5.Big screen size..feels good.. 6.Very interesting factor \"STYLUS\" 7.Good size resolution.. 8.Supports every application...and Run very fast.. 9.Much better then S4.. 10.Last but not the least.....u will get 10gb as internal memory..but in s4 u will get only 8gb....:)","flipkart how do you always satisfy me with your service? Ordered the product on friday and received it on monday.. Only flipkart can pull it out..packing was a lil sluggish still I was happy to see the beast inside. Now for the product. Pros: 1.Massive screen with feather touch sensitivity. Got the latest update of jelly bean too. 2.There's enough memory inside to accomodate a house. Flipkart provides us with an additional 16gb memory card to top the icing. 3.Processor speed and ram are sufficient enough to run games like Max Payne and temple run. 4.Battery back is pretty good. .In fact the best..getd me easi through out the day with heavy usage. 5.Camera is not the best.. still will get you the picture you want. Cons: 1. You will notice the mobile and the charger will heat up during charging and will remain like that till the charge reaches at 80% then it will cool down. That's the only problem i have faced. Once again thank you flipkart and samsung for making life easy for me.","Finally a product to look forward to, be it entertainment, Business or Creative needs. A Powerhouse Device. Well if you can afford anything, this is the only Phone you need to buy. Pros: 1] 5.5 Inch Super HD AMOLED Screen. 2] Ergonomical design for easy handling (you can use this phone even with 1 hand) 3] S Pen - and it's functionalities - ( there are so many shortcuts to number of functionalities, you won't need Home, Back buttons) 4] Smooth UI 5] Whopping 2GB of RAM & 16GB inbuilt memory ( you can use 10.75 GB only out of this, but I have no issues with that ). 6] 3100 mAh Battery - works for almost 1.5 days for me. 7] Great, rather I would say enhanced functionalities than SIII (in it own domain) 8] Best for Business purpose as well as entertainment, Multifunctional usage. 9] Great Camera Quality 10] Finally, Great user experience. Cons: 1] This Phone needs a MICRO-SIM, beware of having it beforehand. 2] \"Top of the Pyramid\" Price. 3] Need to have a Cover and Screen guard immediately - you don't want to have scratches on your Note II's Screen right ? Overall I would say this is the best phone ever. Worth the Price Tag. Go for it! You will never regret it. Thanks to Flipkart for timely delivery as committed. Thanks to Pennyful Cashback for effectively reducing the price tag.","I am using the device for last 20 days and my experience is very good, it is value for money. If you are not a hardcore Ifan then this phone is best. Pros: Screen size Handling (it may look awkward to handle initially but after 4-5 days it is just a normal size gadget) processor speed and RAM (till now no glitches) Good camera running 2 apps on same screen. Detachable battery (you need not to visit service center to replace battery) expandable memory and many more pros. Cons: I dint find any cons but if you purchase a device for its look and feel then its plastic body may be a down for you. if you want to purchase a device for its performance this is the best you can get at this price. For samsung vs Idevice Idevice has retina display and premium aluminium + glass body. except that Note II has upper hand on all the areas.","I just got my phone from Flipkart. When i unbox Note 2. First impression is WOW. A Massive beast powered with highest Configuration can beat anything. Some of my friend says that this phone is too big but seriously This phone comes with one hand operation mode. Screen is too clear a True HD. Powered with too many features Like Airview, Gestures, Smart Stay, Smart Eye Rotate, NFC, and much more. Sorry to mention 1 main thing that this is worth the money you cant get this features in the market. Also This is the Most Expensive Phone in The market. Not iPhone because iPhone 5 cost is Around 650$. I am not happy to pay Rs.48000 for iPhone. All i want to say that this is must buy if you ready to spent 37k. And the last Flipkart Service is Awesome got the phone in just 2 days even at the Rushing Days of Diwali. Thanks Flipkart. YO Note 2 The Big thing is Already There!","Flabbergasted,is wot i was when i used it.Purchased this gadgeterial excellence a week back,not from filpkart though.Awesome is very less a an adjective to describe this thing. I am not gona waste ur time on specifications and features,yu can google it,all i can say is that if you really want to have an \"experience\" and have the money or dont care about it..Dont hink twice,purchase it today!! You wont regret even for once!!","I am using Galaxy Note 2 for about 3 weeks now and this is proving to be a masterpiece of an equipment. Some of my experiences with the phone: 1. I didn't really feel the big size, though I was using iPhone 3GS before which is much smaller in comparison. Since my motive was to have the usage of Tablet + Phone combined into one, I never bothered about the size 2. Really powerful phone, never slows you down and your applications will run like a breeze 3. For the power it offers, the 3100 mAh battery gives an unimaginably awesome performance 4. Once you start using Social Media and News apps on this phone, you will never like to use the same apps on smaller phones later. The experience of using them on the bigger screen is unmatchable Overall, this phone proves to be a powerful beast that is powered by the latest version of Android (though 4.2 is almost here). Though Google LG Nexus 4 is something to look out for, this is no lesser a competition!","I received my galaxy note 2 very promptly.I ordered it via COD. I am just about to get my micro sim for me to use the phone(calling and messaging).But I have used all other features using wi-fi where even I made video calls on gtalk and was awesome experience.I can say that galaxy note 2 is the most powerful and sexiest phone. Just forget about the size of the phone but see how great the display is,easy for browsing,gaming,watching movie etc.More to add the S-pen,Wow!!! that's the great invention.It's time for most of them to shift to galaxy note 2 or even S3 to feel that you are on top of the world when it comes to mobiles.Buy it to feel it!! But the only thing was I was upset with the gift they gave as freebie which is nowhere meeting note 2,samsung mono bluetooth device. Instead they could have given a gift voucher or flip case for the samsung which are really essential.I even asked them but they denied as they are unable to change the offers it seems.That's OK.Thanks Flipkart for your tremendous service.","I bought this phone from a Samsung Exclusive dealer and the experience has been amazing. I was looking to buy a top of the line phone which was actually functional as opposed to being only eye candy. Boy, does this phone blow the other models out of the water. The processor is blazing fast, the photo quality is excellent. For people who say that the sound isn't loud enough, maybe it's time to take a hearing test or stop working at the granite quarry. The battery life is amazing. Just install Juice Defender, it'll take care of that for you. If you have the money to buy this, just buy it without so much as a thought. You can review 5 phones for 30 days and buy this phone or you can buy this straightway. I did the former and I'm now a proud owner of this magnificent device. And I'm glad to see that Flipkart revised its pricing, more or less on par with what's available outside.","Nice to handle and navigate with but got a scratch in a space of three days. Very flimsy body. Samsung is a Korean company and just like all Korean products -- cars, industrial plants and phones -- this one is true to their manufacturing style. It is being sold in many numbers with lots of advertising but the body does not promise durability. In fact, the customer is also not hoping for a long lasting product. So, I think the manufacturer and customer are even.","What d heck is dis every hour ur changing d prices sm times it 24 k & sm times its 25k. Keep it constant guys. we trust u flipkart.Dis iz nt fair............................","ek dam jhakas phone, sare features hai phone mein, battery life jabardast, at 100% charge from Andheri to Pune starting 03:00 PM to next day morning 6:00 AM 20% of battery is left even after using wifi extensively. No lag while playing games, installed games such as Dark Knight Rises 1 Gb plus and Real Racing 3 1GB plus all games running without lag. Bole to Jhakas Phone hai.Camera bhi ek number hai. Bole to le lena ka bhai log. Chalo abhi vantas ki goli lene ka bye bye","Phone stopped charging within an year. Thankfully it was in the warranty period at that time. After 1 year 4 months phone again stopped working. This time the technician says it is due to either a LCD or a mother board failure (or both) and will cost anything between 7-15 K. My iPhone of 2 years is still going strong. If you are buying android i guess its better to stick to Nexus","I liked the quality of phone, features of the same. Got the good deal from flipkart and quick delivery as usual from them Touch is smooth, camera is good, doesnt lags, monster battery so overall a must buy","This phone's got it all. To be honest, when I now compare my iphone 4 with this phone, I realize how much I was missing out. Screen is AMAZING, Camera is great when there's enough lighting (decent in low light but not great), S-pen is EXTREMELY useful (air view, cutting an image, print screen, many many others!) And google maps - oh google maps!!! How much love do I have for thee?? Imagine a turn by turn navigation for GOOGLE MAPS!!! The best map application on the planet just became BEASTLY!! Let me list some pros off the top of my head: -S Pen is truly amazing -Battery life is LONG. Easily lasts a WHOLE DAY on HEAVY USAGE. -Sound quality is great. -Extremely smooth and fast, navigating through the screens is tremendous! -Extremely flexible (widgets, customizable) - just beats the iphone in every aspect on OS flexibility. -Light for its size - whoever says this is a heavy device is a moron. This phone is as thin as the iphone 4 even though it's JAMMED with an amazing battery. -Androooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!! -Fits in my pocket - at first I was afraid this thing will be too big; it's not. Unless you wear skinny jeans that stop the blood circulation in your legs you should be fine. -5.55 inch screen is just too good. Easy to read eveything, easier on the eyes, a true masterpiece! -Replaceable battery, Micro-SD slot!!! Add all the movies and pictures you want!!","Well, I wanted a smartphone and went for it due to its decent specs, comparatively lower price, the exchange offer, cashback scheme offered in flipkart.com. After using it since last one month, I can say it satisfies all my needs and it is a good smartphone. I surf the web, check my mails, twitter, youtube, whatsapp; all works fine if not very well. BTW I'm writing this review from my Note 2 :)","Though I did not purchase it from flipkart as I wz running out of patience to get my hand on ds beast even fr atleast one day which I knw flipkart wld hv delivered in... Newyz moving on to the PHABLET as Samsung puts it, one word/opinion \"Jz go fr it\" wdout any secnd thought as it is a milestone handset from Samsung n never be wiped away frm consumer's mind fr atleat 2-3 yrs n top f dt it will get update on OS, I will nt go into the specs as a lot have already been said and talked abt dese. I am using it fr da last 4 days and m simply loving it, be it da form factor, hw it feels on your hand wn u hold it n walk around holding it, the mesmerising HD AMO display, the web browsing, the buttery smooth touch response etc etc. In conclusion: If your budget is 30k and you PHABLET fan, dnt wait fr a nano second and grab it... YOU will NOT regret!!!!!","Well, first, I should admit that its very BIG, a little on the tougher part on handling with and/or typing with one hand. But i guess i will get used to it, hopefully ! I bought the product since it was paying me awesome return value for my Nokia C3, secondly an additional 10% disc on SBI CC. I got the phone for just 24750. Functions - I will put an addendum to this review after few days of using it.","I received it today afternoon. And this is my genuine review: Pros: 1. Superrrrrrb display..I thought this phone would be big to handle. But believe me guys. I have got medium hands and I am able to handle it properly without any problem and the samsung keyboard also is very helpful when typing single handed. Special feature of keyboard shifting sides according to right/left handers. 2. Performance is toooooo good.. 3. I have seen in couple of reviews that Camera is just average. But I found it really good. This cam takes really decent clarity pics and there is no lag at all from one pic to next pic. Cons: 1. Ear phones are not at all good. It doesn't seem like even a branded phone/ear phones if you are only listening to music without looking at the phone. Samsung can do a lot better regarding this. 2. I stay in Bangalore and I used to get my deleveries on the next day I ordered or atleast 2nd day. But this one took 3 complete days to reach me. Though I received it as per the dead line, still its late being in Bangalore. 3. I was told that it will be an exact exchange. I mean I will be provided with new phone and they will take my old phone on the same day/time. But to my surprise, Flipkart guy came to me the day before I got my SG Note-2 for taking my old phone. As I am having one more spare phone, I have returned my old Samsung Galaxy Y. Otherwise what is the situation? But talking about the phone, it is an awesome experience. You can't go back to 4 inch or even 4.8 inch s3 after getting used to this display size. The experience is just 'Pha'ntabulous..It may be a game or reading on FlipBoard or viewing some high clarity pics. It is good. Finally about exchange scheme. Every one knows that its not 10k discount on your old phone.Everyone who bought this/ thinking to buy may already have done enough research on the local market price tags and other online sites. If you think so, wait for 3 to 4 months more till Note3 is released so that you can get it for Rs.27500 without exchanging your phone. Its marketing guys...10k is a big number for posters. So discount will be definitely on MRP to highlight that 10k figure. Hope my review is a little useful...One suggestion for the guys who is banging their head in confusion just because of only one thing..screen size..Go for it..And you will later appreciate your decision ..really..I am one of those guys that I have mentioned just now..:)","My overall experience with this phone is amazing. 1.In terms of battery the phone provides better power backup and battery charges very fastly. 2.Camera is pretty good and video recording is very clear. 3.Games are very much playable. 4.Touch is pretty nice. 5.Size is nice for users who like big screen to watch movies and play games. My personal opinion : This is a great phone to buy","I have used Samsung Galaxy S3 and Google Nexus 4 in the past and did a lot of research before buying this and trust me this is the best phone available till date. It true that its a bit bigger compared to other phones available but its not bulky. Has a big screen and S pen. battery backup is very good. Choose the \"Titanium Grey\" model over \"white\" because dark color feels smaller than white. And If you talk about flipkart service .... its awesome .... ordered it on Saturday Night 10PM and Phone was delivered on Monday 11AM .... I have been using flipkart for a while now and looks like have started compromising on the packaging part. In the past they were sending packages in bubble bags to avoid any mishandling and now just a plain cardboard box with Samsung box inside it .... please use best packaging for at-least electronics good that are expensive ....","This is the best phone in the market at the present time It is better than Galaxy SIII , it is better than Iphone5 and it is better than any other phone out there Now about Note II Its quad core 1.6GHz processor can run any application smoothly without any freeze and it can also run more than one app easily without being slow...It has 2GB ram which is more than any other smartphone and it is enough for all the applications..Its Mali400 graphics can smoothly run any game without any lag..its big 5.5\" screen looks beautiful and videos look very beautiful especially HD...It has a 3100mAh which is itself a beast and you dont need to charge the phone for 1-1.5 day if u play heavy games watch hd videos and do multitasking otherwise it can last for 2-2.5 days easily..The Spen is really amazing and the air feature is very accurate...the phone is a beast and the one who owns it will surely be proud..believe me it is better than iphone 5 which has a dual core processor and 1gb ram..iphone 5 is onl in the market due to the tag APPLE. If u are confused in buying iphone 5 or note II and have no problem with big screen then surely note II is the phone to buy..","Although i had purchase it from local store but comenting for better clearity. I will only highlight Cons because pros are a lots. 1) major thin that i dislike about this device is BLURRY. while scrolling contacts or playing Games if thing are in motion it tend to make thing blurry e.g. while clicking pic shake your hand. its only an expamples for you to understand what i am talking about. if want a better clearity on what im saying install real racing 2. you'll understand. 2) android is havly OS. yes you'll find some lag. but better than other device. 3) shitty Theme i didn't like it that much. Try installing Nova launcher. (Best. Recommended) 4) few games are not compatible. it really irratating. 5) Since i use 3g for more than 4 yrs believe me i still feel like using one. (Please don't compare it with Iphone. its simply da best) 6) don't know its only me or else are also facing it but Google play don't download or update. Its really irritating. 7) Most of the time its says can't install free some space although 790MB is already free. irritating but not so much since i install using third party. 8) i don't know its my headset or mobile but sound clearity is not up to the mark. compared it with iphone 3g i prefer iphone.. someone who is really into sounds will understand. Over all amazing device Plz don't thing about screen since i was also against it but when you get used to it you will not see any other fone. ( all of a sudden i used iphone 3g felt like im using some child fone. ate it royally) Best features: pop up browser (Da best or all), multi window, 2GB ram worth, Power saving mode(Worth), bigger screen, incerase volume (compared with S3), Piece of advice: Please don't purchase flipcover its not worth investing 1600 on it. it make your fone from prince charming to shrek). again not worth. Don't destroy the beauty. don't compare with iphone please. Don't root it. its best. im really great in rooting but i didn't feel like doing it because nova launcher did what rooting would had done for me. Simply great launcher.","About Note 2, it is indeed very difficult put things in one review...because Note 2 actually provides you with huge, diverse capabilities Pros: - The size. Few people have cribbed on the huge size. Honestly, it is because of the size that I (and I am sure others too) bought it. Infact, other 'smaller' mobile phones now look so out of the place. - I have sold my Galaxy Ace & my Dell laptop and purchased Note 2 as a replacement of these 2 devices. And believe me, Note 2 is indeed a phablet. I have rarely felt the lack of laptop after I bought Note 2. - Touchscreen is buttery smooth. - 1.6 GHz Q core, 2 GB RAM give you all the muscle to run as many applications as you want without a glitch - S Pen is one of the greatest marvels to be used so intelligently on a digital device. Be it taking notes, drawing, reading..the S Pen handles all these so intuitively. - Samsung has excellently embedded Touchwiz with Jellybean in terms of usability and aesthetics - The intuitiveness with which features like Smart Stay, Quick Glance, Motion Alerts are devised, you may start wondering if iPhone is miles behind in terms of its so called 'intuitive' OS and design - Those who feel that the back cover is made of 'cheap' plastic, let me tell them that the textured back finish gives Note 2 a excellently premium look. Secondly, this very plastic body absorbs shocks & falls much better that any other metal body. (My Note 2 has fallen twice already from a height of around 3 feet :-( Cons: - Camera could have been say 12 megapixel OR it could have been better in lowlight conditions - My Note 2 is Titanium Grey but unfortunately Samsung gives 'only' white colored charger and earphones in the box which don't really match - The original flip cover doesn't look premium enough Lastly, let me add that with a gadget so intelligent, fast and intuitive as this, there is a distinct possibility that you may start feeling if this is a Human being... :-)","This is a masterpiece from samsung. I never felt the size to be too big. s-pen is superb and so, is the mobile. u can enjoy movies on the go. the best: super battery multi tasking pop video player super music player ...one word boombox Review after One Year: Still my fav phone. Just switched to 4.4.2 DN3 custom rom. And installed Viper Audio.. Now I can't find a phone that can sound better then ViperAudio.. (Tested HTC One, iPhone , Nokia 1520 (Though I would have never picked the boring windows OS even if it would have been good)).","this phone mind blowing. i loved the S.Note in it i thanks samsung for giving us such advanced technology. this phone is far ahead from iphone 5.......i was an apple freak before buying this phone. but i think if had bought an iphone i would have regretted after knowing about the features of this phone its great to have it in my pocket....i would just that if you are about to buy an iphone 5 dont waste your 45000 after that crap....but note 2....but still i must say it is all about your choice...rather than that its a great phone.....","With 2 GB ram and 1.6 Ghz quard core processor with 5.5 inch Super AMOLED it roars like a lion ,still what u need for a 36 grand ? and with inbox jelly bean next update will be damn sure ... works like a racing car ,,,throw 1000 of apps at it ,,it never slow down this beast Samsung started a new revolution in mobile market ,,,atleast this mobile will be top notch for 2 years","S3 Note II RAM 1 GB 2 GB Screen Big Bigger Battery Good Better Stylus No Yes, Nice features Price 35000 38500 Verdict The Hickup in chosing is because Note II is better and hardly more expensive then S3 , but also with impractical size. Practical Solutions (1) ignore that Note II exists in market and go for S3. (2) Get Note 2 as pocket tab and own a small phone also. :) Ram","Samsung Galaxy Note 2 is an excellent product. The latest OS 4.1 works like a breeze, handwriting recognition is superb, predictive text too is brilliant...8 megpix camera is super, touchscreen very reponsive...all in all a must have smartphone. Flipkart delivery has been super fantastic. My favorite shopping place....","galaxy note 2 is very powerful cool looking phone though it looks big but its design so good that it fits in hand very nicely,with 2 gb ram it is futureproof phone and will get all updates from android for long time,grey colour is so perfect in this phone it looks stunning,i will say only one word just simply buy this phone and u will love it","The Galaxy Note 2 is an excellent piece of Engineering. The First SmartPhone to have 2 GB Memory. However its available 4k cheaper on other Retail Portals. Flipkart should reduce the Selling Price.","I got this from flipkart just about a week ago. As usual the delivery was on time (ACTUALLY BEFORE TIME) so no questions about the flipkart. Now on the phone It has got everything you can get in a phone Pros an amazing widescreen 5.55\" screen (HD super AMOLED) 1.6 gHz QUAD CORE processor With 2 GB RAM (so fast) Android 4.1 Jellybean S Pen With awesome features like Airview ( Defies laws of physics!!!) Has Got CORNING GORILLA GLASS 2 Battery is amazing (fast charge, Best backup) S voice is responsive an impressive camera with all features, front camera is also very good I can't write all pros 'cause they are so many!!!!!!! CONS The only con I can find is that it's so fast (JUST KIDDING!!!) it is a must must buy Much better than apple (I was using Apple before this) in less price","People who're wondering, as for why they should by Note II despite the S4 and HTC One release here's something to ponder over. I've owned this device for a month now, and a friend of mine has owned one for 4 months. And I can vouch for this amazing device. I initially bought this merely for the ginormous screen, but was dumbfounded by the power that the Note 2 packs. And I've not even explored it in entirety. Great screen, Best battery life for any android device I've ever used - these alone makes the device great. Although S-Pen seemed a gimmick initially, I'm in love with it now and use it on a daily basis. And the speaker quality is surprisingly amazing, and if you have rooted GN2, it's just out of the world. Camera quality is fine, but the stock app is exceptionally good. All in all, this is a phone you'll hang on to for a LONG time. It's not just about specs, you'll fall in love with it once you begin using it. PS: I have no idea how such a stupid comment got voted as \"most helpful\". HDTV and ACs get upgrades too - every single technology evolves. If you can't accept that, why feel the need to come over here and spam your narrow minded opinions here? Don't buy. Save your preachy nonsense for yourself and don't buy any smartphone. End of.","SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 GOD of Smart Phones... Zeus.. Beast.. Super phone... iPhone smasher/eater/killer.. Massive screen.. ultimate device with Mighty mind blowing quad core with huge 2 gig of RAM.. True feeling of technological enlightenment.. Pure gadgetry ecstasy. Just have to wait 4 days more.. then.. I will be a proud owner of this phone. Going to dump my HTC One X.. its been wonderful 6 months with HOX.. now its time to say good bye.","Here's the Galaxy Note II. Amazing. Superb. Stunning. Add any good word, and the Note II is exactly the same. The screen is 10 on 10. The animations or the effects the phone delivers, 10 on 10- they make you so happy! As if the phone is acting on your orders! The phone is so much full of features. You can ACTUALLY see the multitasking being done-LIVE. This feature is called Split-Screen Multitasking. You're messaging someone, and surfing the web simultaneously! The phone is SIMPLY beautiful! Go buy it even if Flipkart sells it at eighty thousand!","I am totally Speech less ...........Very Good Tech...Awesome Fetchers.........Very Brightness ......Gr8 Touching ...............friendly operating....TOTALY WORTH OF MONEY......& ALSO GOOD SERVICE FLIPKART...i WAS PURCHASED FROM FLIPKART","Guys This Phone Is Awesome But 36k For A Phone You Can Buy A LCD TV , AC etc . You Also Can Invest It In Stocks And Shares And Enjoy The Dividend Technology Is Changing Day By Day . Tommorow Samsung Is Gonna Come Up With Samsung Galaxy S4 Apple With Iphone 6. Then You May Find This Phone Outdated . Waste Of 36K I Insist That By A Phone Which Is Somewhere Within 15K - 20K And Will Remain In The Market And IS Useful . This Phone Is For People Who Are Designers And Executives Or Some One Who Has Real Value . But Not For Show off OVERALL THIS IS AN AWESOME PHONE REALLY SMART BUT THINK TWICE BEFORE SPENDING 36K","Please dont waste such a lot of money on this phone ...overall the phone is good..i used it for a month and got rid of it..very big phone very uncomfortable software and hardware wise its good but then its not that practical and price is too high..samsung is just a step better than chinese phones..build quality is very poor..slippery glossy and big size very hard to carry i dropped it thrice in one month thankfully didnt break and i sold it for 30 k ..go for micromax canvas instead and save money buy a hd tv instead ..i will never buy a samsung phone not until they start spending more on research and less on publicity!!!!","though they are fully justified to do so! - it is not Morally correct on the part of Samsung to withdraw the 15% cash back offer without adequate warning - they could at least have flashed a banner giving the last date - well i will not buy it without the offer !! cheers","I have bought this phone after waiting long to buy a phone which meet my needs for next 2-3 Years. Earlier I desired to have Note 1 after experiencing in my hand but waited. I am not going with configuration but reason to have this. 1) A Great camera- It match both Video & Pictures with decent benchmarked Camera. It gives all option which a smart camera has. You can save 8k to 14K if you buy this phone. Rather less bulky camera. 2) A Great Gaming Device.- It easily beats PSP & Gaming x box other gaming Device. Note 2 provide integrated gaming device backed with Popular Mali 400 GPU with astonishing 1.6 Quad core processer with 2 GB RAM. It saves at least 9 K to 20k money on Gaming device. 3) A Great Internet& Social Hub & computing Device \u2013 It matchs with decent laptop & tablet to meet your computing needs. Since Screen is 1/3rd smaller & absence of keypad does not give you a laptop experience but Stylus Pen will add some fun to operate but I still believe, It saves 50% of current laptop device need say 10K to 15K 4) A Great Multimedia player- It gives you experience like Ipod \u2013 a Any great MP4 . It saves 5K if you wish to have great multimedia device. 5) A good Phone with all rich Audio & Video quality. It saves your 2k on basic & good branded phone. Now some additional Pros to have this phone It is all in one device with portability. It is much bigger device to hold in your palm but after a week you are glued to it & forget this. It also comes with futuristic Technology which somewhere make a pleasurable experience like pop up play, Smart stay, NFC , customisable screen etc. you need to spends weeks to explore all its features. It comes with Great battery Backup with 3100 MAH which is far better than above mentioned devices hence it last at least 10 hours if continuously talk, surf & watch Video with single full charge. It last 2-3 days if you moderately use this device. It also beat easily 20K to 25k devices which lacks some of great features of this phone specially battery & performance. It is not a budget phone but a phone for future need. In next coming year we see 4G in mobile segment in Indian market then you will feel difference of having this device. Samsung have innovated this after having great success with Galaxy & Note 1 & Made this device to keep in mind it gives you sweet surprise by using this. I love this phone for its Size Performance & Its capability to do what an ideal device has. It is costly but quality never comes at cheap price.","The phone is very large compared to others but not large enough to make you look like a dork while calling. Its somewhere between a phone and a tablet, giving you the best of both worlds. The processor is a quad core 1.6ghz one, giving the note 2 a processing power equal to that of a pc. The screen is large, but it should easily fit in the hands of an adult. The screen is sharp as expected of a super AMOLED screen. Picture quality is great, colours are vivid and pictures are sharp. The ram is 2 gb , allowing you to perform more processes at once and reduce lag. This phones performance is equal to that of a pc. The battery life is excellent, and more than s3's. People go for the s3 more, 'cause of its size. But some fail to notice that the note 2's performance greatly overshadows s3's. The s pen is a great addition, giving an accurate touch experience. The phone is a bit heavy and difficult to carry around , so you have to put it in a bag, as it may not fit in the pocket, so i recommend a bluetooth headset to be used with this. Overall this phone is great, have not found any cons. I prefer this over s3. Great job samsung.","I am using this phone since 10 days now. Excessive use. I did a lot of R & D before buying this handset, and therefore, I have a great yearn to explain and remove the confusions, doubts and hesitations that I too had before buying this product. 1. First, we understand that many people didn't have a good experience with Samsung phones because of the mutations and customization it has had done with their Galaxy series, but true to my experience and our understanding, we must admit, that Note is a completely different series. With quad core processor and 2 GB RAM you are not going to feel the lag. Trust me. 2. This phone is not that big. It's a hype. It's one of the most beautiful thing that will look in your hand. For girls hesitating, listen, I understand, it's not made for your tiny denim pockets, my best friend(girl) holds it in her hands all day, and it gives a rich-look to her. 3. Which color? I know many are going to agree and many disagree. After a lot of experimentation, you know keeping gre phone in hand, then white, then putting either phone on ears, looking in the mirror, did everything you know, white is better. Eventually, you are going to put a flip cover for this phone, use black. Now, why white, if you are using a black cover? Because, white look in front reflects better contrast and colors when you are working over the phone. 4. Performance proves that the specs mentioned are worthy and deserving. 5. Writing Note is awesome, you can do anything with it, you know. Though one thing to mention, I was crazy for this note thing, but haven't used it much. It's human nature. Don't drop the idea to buy this phone even if you are not a Note user, as the specs and performance is very good.","First of all I used Acer , samsung duos s and then note 2 android devices .. And with decent knowledge m' writing this review The biggest thing about the note 2 is amoled 2 screen .. the screen comes with not only with Quality it is very smooth to touch .. you can play games , watch movies , do web surf what ever the first thing plays a vital role is screen .. m' really love with this amoled 2 screen .. m' sure amoled 3 will do better job which comes with note 3 and s4 .. The second thing is Speed .. the speed is A9 chip with Quad core so I never find any app till now this phone hands .. i use like about 60 apps but my phone works very smooth .. and its responsive is making me always buying samung products in future note 3 or note 4 and so .. Things like graphics , sound Quality (headset) etc are good not the best but good .. it is very slim and sexy .. dont tell me iphone have Quality and these samsung phones are not .. you can only tell when you really used it for long time .. about smart features ?? Damm samsung tell you very few smart features about the phone .. there are thins like easy swipe to call , best call blocker in the world , and many many features wil take this smart phone to high peak .. if you are person who love things like tools , smart features etc .. this phone is for you . no secondary thought .. for the people who gave 1 star .. m' 100% sure this phone is not for you and you are not eligible for atleast giving reviews .. On considering all features and things Quality m' giving this phone 5 star Dont care about screen guys .. you will feel better while playing games , movies , web surf big screen plays a big role .. so 5.5 is must for a mob .. buy alternate mob some cheap mob for carrying outside like gameplaying etc .. m' really impressed with my note 2 I agree samsung is really poor in giving latest updates .. they do because they want to earn money from their latest mobiles .. I hate samsung for only that reason else everything is fine ..","This phone is available in the market for just only 28000rs and you should think about buying new pants which have big pockets When buying phone in flipkart we have to check the current market price because some new smart phone price increase by 2k or 3k,some may have lower price In the market the price of mobile change daily depending on market demand but flipkart only update thier price once in a month The main usefulness of flipkart is availablitiy of product and accessories which are not available on the market","One word for this phone------------------ AWESOME Ordered via flikart yesterday and got the phone today ultimate speed delivery by flipkart.

You wont do the first charging of this phone until you get used to the initial part of it. Its a great phone and lots and lots of features. Great buy..!!!","I have a smartphone from Blackberry/Nokia/Apple/Samsung/HTC and have always been dissatisfied with one thing or another. After waiting (with eventual disappointment) for the iphone 5 launch, I finally decided to go for Note 2. Am happy to report that my search for a good smartphone has finally come to an end... and I'm going to list only the pro's 1. Big screen - perfect for watching movies on long flights. You don't need a tab anymore. 2. Big Battery - I have more than 3-4 hours of voice calling everyday + constant data browsing, etc etc - I still end up with >40% battery by night. 3. Pen - very helpful for making little notes","The first thing you look at when you see/hold the phone is the display. Note2 wins your heart then and there. It's not too big to hold as people have misperceived, unless you have palms of a 14year old(I hope people get the sarcasm!!). Battery has been better with any other phone, 3100mAh, as compared to 1650mAh of that os S2, can power the beast through 1.5days of rigorous use and 2-2.5 days without sync and internet. Kudos to Anup for such a wonderful review, he said it all. Apple needs to work hard to catxh up with Samsung, when you talk about Smartphones. And my advice to flipkart, please atleast censor the language being used in the review, I hope you guys do have moderators!!!","i recently buy galaxy note 2. it is very good phone for whatevery u want to use. iphone 5 is nothing. so go for galaxy note2 Pros: 1] 5.5 Inch (Huge) Super HD AMOLED Screen. 2] Ergonomical design to be handled easily (you can use this phone even with 1 hand) 3] S Pen - and it functionalities - ( there are so many shortcuts to number of functionalities, you won't need Home, Back buttons) 4] Smooth - Operations 5] Whopping 2GB of RAM & 16GB inbuilt memory ( you can use 10.75 GB only out of this, but no issues). 6] 3100 mAh Battery - it works almost 1.5 days for me. 7] Great, rather I would say enhanced functionalities than SIII (in it own domain) 8] Best for Business purpose as well as entertainment, Multifunctional usage (this Firmware Upgrade is not confirmed yet). 9] Great Camera Quality & functionalities. 10] Finally, Great user experience.","I just wana say that, if u analyze properly there are no cons in this phone. Its just the best in market, and even in upcoming phones. It will surely rule even after launching of HTC DLX or LG Vu or Sony Odin. Note 2 has better configuration and hardware as compared to other upcoming phones. Its way beyond iphone 5, and any other phone. Proud to own the god of smartphone :)","You dont have to think twice about buying this product. Its the fastest and the most powerful phone in the market right now with a fantastic battery for an android device. The only thing one needs to decide is if you want a phone of this size. For me the bigger the better.","Pros : Everything is super perfect. Cons : At first it hangs up due to lots of apps I had installed. but later when I took backup of all and did factory reset option. It works great and fast.","Note 2 - Amazing phablet but Samsung needs to attend to technical glitches with more ease on 28 July 13 JYOTI%20PRAKASH rated: certified buyer I have purchased it in the month of Jan 2013 and I can still say that I am proud of the product and its capacity . It is still one of the best phablets around (can say it is still within the top 3 ) Product : The Note 2 with flip cover is an amazing combo . Both are so much empty without the other :) .Note 2 as a phone is amazing . It is super large in every aspect . The Super AMOLED screen is simply the best you get in the market and honestly , after I watched the movies/videos/pictures on my Note 2 , the LED TV , my HD Camcoder , and Laptop viewing simply fades away .It is very good for movies , gaming , videos and also while editing stuff .Although some might argue it is very large for the single hand operation , it does have single hand operation mode , which makes it easy to handle many functionalities . The Camera is good and it takes crystal clear photos in most conditions. The auto focus works like charm and quality of photos is good for developing a standard 6X4 photo .I even tried developing a bigger size photo and it was ok ,if not better than most cameras. The video quality is amazing and it strikes a chord with every viewer whether on the Note 2 screen , or on laptop or on TV. I have tried many amazing features from you tube like tap to top of list , screen shot by swipe , adding hovering controls , etc . I think there is still many things to explore . The capabilities of this phone never stops to amaze me . Technical Glitches : It has developed some technical glitches now ,which I think I will take it to the Samsung service center for repair . - The voice quality has gone down and you hear a lot of brrr noises while you speak - There are some part of the screen which has gone unresponsive sometimes - The phone does not connect to Kies Normal but connects to Kies Lite . So some of the important features of Kies is left unexplored - The firmware update is a bit problematic and very time taking Flipkart Service : The packaging and delivery was excellent ,although I would like the flipkart people to update the firmware to the latest version before delivering . You get the latest firmware ,as of date of purchase , when you get it from shops like Univercell , Sangeeta etc . Mine was quite primitive when it was delivered to me","Please do not purchase this mobile from here at this rate. Croma site is providing the same at 24999. go for it.","Excellent phone. Am really happy with the product and best price. Note II is really a good phone when comes to smart phones. Pros: 1. Nice Clear Display 2. Superb Camera (8MP) 3. Awesome Speaker Sound 4. Connectivity speed is very good both in wifi and gprs (2G/3G). 5. Supports almost every feature available ever (Wireless charging, NFC, Infra-red, bluetooth 3.0, Hot-Spot for Wifi, etc...) 6. Very useful accessories available like samsung power bank (9000Mah), Wireless charging pad, S-View Cover, etc...) Cons: 1. Back side speaker.","Best phone.. There is nothing i can mention more about this phone. People already wrote good reviews. Only thing i wanted to mention that.. after Kitkat Update Note 2 was more faster and got better backup.","I bought this phone back in September 2012 and been using it since continually. First of I would say that I am literally surprised to see that even till date Note 2 is more expensive than Note 3. I have been playing FIFA 14 since 6 months and note it is really a hefty game.. It is almost 2 GB game and requires exceptional graphics. This phone has never lagged behind any any application.. I have never been a fan of Samsung but after using this phone my perception has changed... It has fell of atleast 4-5 times from my hand from a height of 4 ft and once in a bucket full of water but to my speechlessness it has proved its vigorousness. The built quality is absolutely brilliant. Just a little bit of thing that Camera qulity had been better.. Though not complaining...","Used so many smart phones..but after a long time I am much happy with Note 2. 1. Battery- Almost I used every time so many application including games,but it gives 2 days back up. 2. I just love this 5.55 display with full HD. 3. Sound quality is too good and 64 expandable ....just WOW. 4.Superb Camera quality. 5. Even I don't able to find any single Cons for this phone. 6. All in One functions..","As always, Flipkart's delivery times are admirable. And they try to accommodate requests for delivery ahead of schedule on special occasions which is one big reason I stick with these guys. The phone itself: Much to like here. Brisk phone, large screen, large fonts, pretty easy to use. AMOLED screen, good specs and not too much lag. Most Android phones have way too much lag once they're in use for a few months. So still on the fence on that parameter. I do feel I've made a good purchase and would recommend it to anyone who's considering it. Ordered this for my father and he enjoys using this phone.","I had two phones with me, one was Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and another one was a blackberry bold2. Both were bought in 2012. Since than motherboard of note2 has been changed twice and again it got faulty. First two times in warranty period so i didnt paid anything but now it got faulty and i need to pay 7800/- as asked by samsung service center. Guys, it is a wonderful phone on speed and features but it is extremely prone to hardware faults. Plastic is cheap. The black chrome polish went away in a year leaving my note2 as a ugly device. On the other hand even after using blackberry note2 there is no issue...","Great feature and configuration. Very happy with its performance. Buying experience was awesome. Bought on Saturday evening and received it next morning. Overall very happy with my decision and the product.","Nice phone .Using it for more than year . Battery works around a day with good amount of usage.Dont install knox it uses up a lot of battery","I did a detailed research based on monetary and usability aspect on mobiles and finally centered onto Note 2. It was little overpriced, but i got a great deal on flipkart. If you are an engineer and or designer, the S-pen feature is and added advantage. Other specs are very good and decent. But, if you are not involved in designing or drawing activities, Grand 2 would be a better choice.","Well I am writing this comment quite late, because I don't want to give feedback while I didn't use the phone for long time, as new phones always function nicely. So after using the phone for almost 11 months I found it very useful and price worth. I like to give the feedback in the following points: * Nice Display: 267 ppi makes the awesome display, all the media items look much better then any other same range phones. * Sound: Sound is nice, although the volume is not so high. But for me it is good enough as I don't use my phone as a BIG speaker. * Fast: 1.6 GHz quad-core Cortex-A9 makes the phone to give nice and smooth feeling. * Camera: Camera performance is amazing, one can make many click continuously without any hurdle. * S-Pen: This is the one of the most amazing things it has. After purchasing this phone I almost stop using the paper diary and all. It also allows me to make some of the very nice sketches and art work while I am free or travelling. * Battery: Battery is almost OK. And at last I want to say, \"One should be smart to use the smart phone with it's full potential\"","I had bought Samsung Galaxy Note around a year back. Since last few days it has started freezing and restarting. Internal storage is getting filled very fast and no option to reduce it. Camera is not per the camera's in Sony phone. night shots are not of that great quality. I am regreating my decision on spenidng lot of money on this phone and it worked good only for 1 year. the parts used inside the phone are cheape. These Korean and Chinese products are same from outside they look goo but inside they cheap parts. It also heats up very fast","excellent phone. Nice camera with a good battery life and moreover splendid service and delivery by flipkart. m loving this phone.","Two times my mobile fall down from my hand and the glass got destroyed from everywhere and the cost of this front glass is more then 8000. As the size too big it should have anti shock drop.","Awesome product from amsungThe deliveas on time. Still trying to learn to use alle features in the device. As the review states its abeast.he bateryis awesome. Worth money","Samsung amazes me with this phone. I'd a Note 1 (extremely innovative and capable device) which I upgraded to Sony Xperia Z (extremely bad phone). I sold off Sony Xperia Z within 4 months and bought the Note 2. Absolutely big and gorgeous screen with vivid colors. Samsung has been brilliant with Note series of Phones.","Why buy Note 3 for 20k extra...Believe me its still an awesome phone to buy even after an year of its launch. Zero lag even for high end games like Asphalt 8. Go for it people !!! Flipkart Service Rocks !!!","I am using this mobile from 6 months now; it\u2019s a brilliant smart phone I have never used. Response is pretty fast compared to the rest of the android smart phones, though I don\u2019t want to comment on the models/brands. Best things: Battery, Call Quality, Camera, Applications response, Touch Screen. Pretty happy with my investment, though I struggled to pay it back to the bank :) Only thing I hate. When others touch my phone, they say \u201dits huge\u201d :D - ram's.darapu","I was contemplating between 2 products Note 2 (Rs 31500) and Canvas 4 (Rs. 16100) for several months. Thought about it for a very long time and then saw some reviews of note 2 where they said it was not worth the price where as the Canvas 4 was value for money. Only thing which was bothering me was the brand name \u201c Micromax\u201d Finally I ordered for the Canvas 4 for Rs 16100. and got it promptly on time as usual excellent service from Flipkart. I used the phone for a week, downloaded couple of games and apps like FB, Whatsapp, Clash of the clans, FB, Subway Surf etc.. The Screen started flickering and couple of times went blank and rebooted. I immediately logged a replacement request and Flipkart promptly replaced the Phone. Now it is working fine. After couple of days Flipkart came up with an exchange offer for Note 2, I exchanged my 4 year old Nokia E5 for an discount of Rs 5000 less on the Note 2. It was a great offer. Now I had 2 phones \u2026. Gifted my wife with the canvas 4 and kept the note 2 ;-(. While Comparing both the phones:- The Canvas Internet speed is much faster as compared to the Note 2 The 13MP Camera and the clarity of Canvas is beyond comparison to note 2 wiz 8MP But the large screen of the Note 2 makes the photos look better. The Samsung touch screen response is better than the canvas 4 Display Quality : The front screen is awesome very smooth as compared with the Micromax canvas 4 Canvas 4 comes fully loaded with all accessories like Additional flip cover Screen guard which is not available with Note 2 Note 2 response in wifi is great Note 2 has a bigger display size and is cumbersome while answering calls or operating with single hand even though it has a feature of one hand operation, the problem is the screen is so big that u have to use all your fingers to support the phone it is difficult to press any button. The display size of canvas is accurate and is comfortable in operation. However both the phones are large for single hand operations of people who travel a lot \u2026. It becomes difficult to drive and operate. The Thickness of Note 2 is much lesser than the canvas and is very sleek. The Spen is not available in Canvas 4. It is a cool device and nice to use the Spen when you are lounging. And people notice and identify it\u2026 :-) You can always flaunt your note 2 as compared to a canvas 4. Comparing both the phones and using both the phones first hand given the choice I will prefer the note 2. This product is really good value for your money.","Beaware of buying Samsung Note 2 I have bought Samsung Note 2 in May and was feeling happy till I realize the coating of phone is coming off. And my smartphone looks like china made mobile or local company mobile. With lots of hopes I contacted Samsung Service Center and then i got reply that scratch and body damage is not cover in warranty. I tried explaining them difference between scratch and coating but those cheaters were very arrogant on phone and didn't had any valid or convincing answer. And this is the case with almost all samsung phones. They have started capturing Indian market with degradation in quality. Fooling people for their desire to own touchscreen phones.","If you want a Note 3 but are short on cash, then this is your answer. Just go to XDA and you can get all the Note 3 features. The hardware is miles ahead of the cheap Mediatek quadcores that are flooding the market.","u can buy nexus 5 at the same rate which of snapdragon 800+, 2gb ram,True HD IPS+ capacitive touchscreen,Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400,","Although I had bought this mobile from local market of kolkata (only at 29500/-) but I think a review on it has to be there. Note 3 is on now but after using all kinds of phone in my life i can say this is the perfect one now till date. You need a month to discover the facilities given by samsung. Battery is smooth and so as the processor while playing high end games like FIFA14. A great buy indeed.","Best business phone with wide features. you can run many apps at same time, nice phone although in the market. There is no comparison with the Apple brand but i rate it more than sony xperia phones.","Greatest phone by Samsung , I have not tested Note 3 yet but as people say it is better than Note 3. Multitouch windows are a good concept. Caller voice is very clear. S Pen is a interesting addition","Got quick replacement for defective product. Phone is amazing no doubt in tat but freeable item EVERYDAY Battery bank is defective. So deal is not tat much worth. Flipkart price is higher than 4k of market price. So if you take within 10% cashback offer then also its co.es closer to market price. Freeable items make it cheaper but no use as they are defective.","I got this phone just a week back...the service provided by flipkart was exceptional as usual..and the price for which I got the phone frm flipkart was the best deal ever...I got the phone for 26500 with 15% cash back offer and with two freebies worth 2500...now coming to the phone ..I had researched for nearly two months and finally went for note2..and wasnt dissapointd a bit...the phone is smooth as butter...large 5.5 disply with crisp and sharp txt is a true delight...mind you, the siZe is not a issue at all..it is easily pocketable..the 1.6 ghz processor makes it feel as if u r using a computer...its fast as hell..the camera is perfect. .the battery backup is absolutely insane..it gives a more than a days backup..the only con comes to my mind is that the speaker sound is a little low..overall a great phone.i would rate this 9/10...trust me guys...dont hav second thoughts...buy this phone blindly..","I have been using note 2 for a long time. It is worth it. No doubts. The Fablet, I would say, is very good phone for a techie.","hey everyone the phone is nice with all features but...wht abt the design samsung? not updated !!!!,and just a plastic!!!!! 31 k it would b better if would b for spec,feacture overall for 23k and note 3 -46000 omg!!! .......to a mobile then its no way to purchase for middle class ppl...... even note 3 comes with moled fux plastic again ...the 'plastic '....!!!!!!!!! yes that every phone gets heats up after certain period of game use ,that could be exceptional but plastic can't ...if in case of emegency while replacing the back cover v may break and costs some $$$ to replace cozzz plastic.......!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Bought in exchange offer, and due to miscommunication between flipkart cc and e logistics, got a late delivery compared to flipkart's standards. Overall, a great product, though too bulky and huge to be used as a phone.","As we all know Note 3 is out and its their latest flagship with all high specs and stuff... thats cool.. but where the heck is the update for samsung note 2 ? Samsung wont push the update of 4.3 for note 2 and samsung s3 till some time ...till they sell a few pieces of note 3 ... till then we have to stick to this ancient version of android. In my opinion samsung really fails to hold back its customers because of this reason. Apple was happy to give its latest IOS7 to all versions of iphone from 4 to 4s to 5 even though they are yet to release iphone 5s in most of the countries.This is what I'm talking about ... apple has been loyal to its customers and they do not make them feel that are being cheated after a few months from buying their handset.Where as apple is not being partial to those customers who have their latest handset.where as samsung is greedy and wants ppl to go in for their latest flagship hence they have delayed the update for Note 2 and S3 ... what a shame samsung I didn't know u guys can go that cheap just to sell ur latest flagship. Now this will refrain me from buying any samsung products next time.I feel cheated and even after having one of the best phones from samsung I feel that I'm using micromax or carbon who rarely get any updates. Samsung how long does it take to send an update ... ?? are ya guys working on the update thing since 2 months ? U guys would have come upo with an entire new version of android in that time ..and u guys are saying that \"we are testing the latest android updates on samusng s3 and note 2 and then we will release it\" ? seriously ? hahaha say that to a 3yr old and he might believe u... SHAME on u samsung SHAME !!","I have been using this phone for like 3 months. There are a lots of pros which I am not writhing about. Just the two cons which I found till now: 1. Stylus don't work on the softkeys. 2. Don't have a dedicated camera button. Other than these this phone is awesome.","Okay, where do I start? I'm not certifying this phone as a 5 star simply because I bought it. To be fair, everyone complaining about the price of the phone and the fact that samsung will come out with a new phone etc don't get the point of this phone. This phone has very good specs. Make no mistake. 2 gigs of RAM, a very good processor which will hold it's own more or less in the face of competition from the HTC One and the SG Note 3. This phone is primarily a business phone. Push mail, presentations, doc editing, creating and viewing pdfs etc is brilliant. Thanks to the big screen and precision via the s-pen. Airview and the s-pen button are a huge bonus. I've been using this phone for quite some time now and this is my primary device on the go. I also use a google nexus 7. I never really liked Touchwiz till I used the note 2. This is one phone that touchwiz is essential for. Simply because of the way the s-pen utilities have been embedded in the software. IF you plan to flash the phone and install any other ROM, I would recommend any one of the many Touchwiz based custom ROMs available. One thing I loved about the phone is the camera. It's not a showstopper, but has some neat features like the burst mode and great quality. The Note 2 currently is priced at some 32k while the Note 3 is pushing 50k. Price is not a factor but at 32k, this phone is a steal. Also, I should mention the monster battery. I have to charge this phone up once in 2 days. I am a heavy user switching between wifi and 3g and I do use a portable charger for an hour or two but even without, this phone gives me about 18 hours of usage no sweat. If you're looking for a phone to use purely for gaming, this is not the phone for you, though it will perform just as well. If you're looking for a phone purely for entertainment, this might still not be the phone for you. This phone can do a bit of everything. And very well at that. It's a jack of all trades. A very very good Jack.","every feature is just awesome, run n number of programmes, still no lag, what more you can expect out smart phone. simply i love my note2, using from last 9 months and never felt to go for a change. It has never crashed even once. unlike other cell phones.","Nice Look and Feel. Superb Touch Sensitivity as compare to other smart phones. Long Battery life. It will last for around two days whenever you use internet whole day. Applications running are very smooth. It worth to have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 :). Camera Quality of this phone is too good. Since it is having 5.5 inch screen so playing games on it is fun. The Charger chord should be a little more in length so it will be better. Overall it is the best phone available in the market with Flip-kart's Superb speed delivery.","With a quad core processor and 2GB of RAM, this phone really impresses me. The Android 4.1.2 OS runs really smooth. Multitasking is a breeze and there is no lag even with more than 10 apps running at the same time. The large 5.5 inch Super AMOLED Display is really the turning point of this phone. Be it playing games, browsing the net or just going through your playlist, the large screen makes it really easy. Also the 267 ppi pixel density ensures a quality display. This is a phone which amalgamates the best of processing power and a beautiful screen all into a very stylish form factor. I would highly recommend it.","1.Ultimate Processor. Performs multiple tasks easily. 2. Battery 3200 mah is way better than other phones. 3.Looks classy with S pen. 4.Never hangs unlike S3 and xperia phones. 5.Go for it, i have used xperia , S3 as well as i phone 4s, but NOTE 2 has a diff. class.","Quick and hazel free Exchange service from Flipkart/WS Retail. Absolutely no troubles at all. Received product in 4 days flat from ordering. Samsung Note II is a fantastic phone. So many functions, features and Apps, you will never loose curiosity.","Ok i had been following Note 2 ever since its release but was unable to get my hands on it because of the price but thanks to the samsung exchange offer i have it now \\m/... Coming to the Phone Pros: 1.Due to it's big screen many people feel it is difficult to handle but i have never had any trouble with it; leaving the rare cases now and then... and once you get used to this size it's hard to go back to smaller mobiles ( read: iphone) 2.The battery is too good i easily last a day and half even after total abuse of my phone (3G, High graphic games, messaging) 3.S-pen -- This is one hardware people should not miss... I always thought i would never use it but to my surprise i keep using it the more and more i get to know of it's various features. It's great fun too 4.The display is good and the camera too is decent not the best in the market right now but you won't feel bad using it... though low light images may leave you disappointed. 5.The external memory and replaceable battery are also good to have. Cons: 1.The USB charger cable is very small... I hate it. 2.The graphics processor is not the best and when you play graphic-intensive games it shows up a little 3.I'm not a fan of Touchwiz at all the cartoonish icons and interface is not for me i prefer the stock android anyday but there are good launchers out there which can make up for it","I was in a confusion whether to upgrade my phone to GS4 or GN2. I did some research from my own capability, and then made up my mind to buy GN2. From the date I put it into use, I just felt its awesome. Here are my pros and cons from this product a) Very big screen, optimum to replace my tablet. b) build is very good. People who cry about plasticity of Samsung products have never seen it in real. Corning Gorilla2 glasses is icing on the cake. I am using the phone without any kind of flip-cover or screen guard for very first time. c) Touchwiz: I use it on my Tab2 as well. I also have a Samsung Google nexus and nexus7 which have vanilla android. I agree that Google releases early software releases for last 2 devices, but it is tastless for me. I find Touchwiz makes true android customization. There are zillion of features in phone which I am yet to explore on this phone. d) S-Pen: Its true innovation from Samsung, and stands apart from likes of HTC, iPhone etc. Try taking quick notes. Its very convenient than typing on Google keep or some other notes app. Cons: a) size: I agree that phone is very big, and should be addressed as phablet. Samsung provides one hand typing keyboard which is cool at times. b) price: Its bit on high end. But I purchased from exchange offer. Thanks to Samsung for providing good value for my old phone :) c) fonts: I like to customize fonts system-wide. But I dont get such an option. I dont like big fonts used on status bar or elsewhere. I want to control my phone as per my taste. d) No-background: Being super-amoled, I wanted to just say NO to any background. But Android doesnt have this option(same with Google nexus) I need to download a black wall paper and apply it as background. Black looks dead beautiful on the phone. As for cry babies which keep crying in flipkart against expensive/samsung phones, go and get a life. Remember not everyone will buy your allegations against these phones. Great job Samsung! As for flipkart, my feedback, improve your logistics. You take too long time to deliver an item these days. I think you are done with customer acquisition phase, and now doing actual business. Only advantage is 5% bank offer available here. Else it doesn't make sense to sit waiting for your delivery.","Just got it for my mom......super kool wid big AMOLED display, big battery and nice cameras and got it for 27k. S-Pen is super and all these features getting under 30k just go for it.......!!!!!!!! Got it from a Samsung Dealer and not from Flipkart.","Samsung Note 2 a wonderful piece of smart phone to have in this era. With the s pen u can do anything u want to, amazing art piece. Excellent speed & good battery back up seems to be the back bone of the phone , I wonder why people go after I phone when more can be gained with lesser value.","i have not bought this from from FK but im writing just to share ..my 1month experience with this amazing phone.. +'s usb connector---- u can connect any pen drive (i have tried up to 32gb)and it works like a charm ... usb mouse--- it supports any usb mouse and when u connect it a pointer shows up on screen . you can use all the features like left click right click and scroll ... thats a great ease of use. screen size------ is big enough but fits in pocket easily, and i haven't faced any problem using it with one hand as u can manage UI according to your usage ie left handed or right handed. battery------ amazingly it last one day easily with continuous 3g data and calling up to 6-8 hours a day. tap and share ---- u can tap 2 phone back to back and share what so ever is on your screen like pictures and videos.. (i have tried tap share with note 2 and s3 ) tv connector ------- also amazing ... just connect it to any hd tv and get amazed... u can view videos and pics... and playing games is just a great experience ..(you ll have to buy tv connector separately ).. well for now i have experienced this much with my note 2 .. as a conclusion i ll say if u have ur pockets loaded and willing to spend then dont think much just go for it...","I bought this phone with lots of apprehensions wrt to samsung being a not so talked about brand for indian mobile market conditions until it joined with google for android . I have been using Nokia for ages. I am really impressed with features while i have to congregate and spend more time to know this machine fully.This is truly a beast with amount of work load it takes while multitasking. A bit expensive but the EMI offer negates the same. Thanks to flipkart on this timely delivery, just a feedback kindly request your delivery person to ensure that it is delivered somebody at home and not to the watchmen or security which was this case. I think it deserves more respect for the value it has.","Its big. Very big. But then again I have big hands and needed a battery that can take a beating through the day and not die on me by 5pm. The screen is brilliant. The speed & fluidity spectacular - quadcore & project butter really helps! And the battery reminds me of the Energizer bunny. I bought this phone because of its huge battery life vs. the S3 which I thought would be more comfortable to hold and manage. But I have been blown away by the screen. I can't imagine viewing content/play games etc etc on a smaller screen anymore. Negatives - Plastic body - while it doesn't feel cheap it doesn't feel premium either.","This phone is a BEAST. For guys, who are even used to Android, this phone will take some time for you to get adjusted. With whole lot of features at one go, a look into the user manual, wont be bad. However, a bit bigger to hold , carry & use. But that choice has to be made while u see a live demo at the stores only & not commented after purchasing. On a whole, features and quality is awesome. I feel, once you purchase this, you should not feel the need for another phone for next 2 years. However, phones will keep coming, which will offer lucrative deals, but mind you, currently this is the LEADER.","Well there is jsut two ways about it (I) If you can handle the size .. you will love it. (II) If you cant handle the size... then look somewhere else And oh, yes miromax and its ilk are cheaper.. but then if you wanted the canvas dont look at the note 2 for a compare (unless u want to look silly). Probably the grand or the new mega might be more you cup of tea.","first of all it's a unthinkable performer in its class .no smart phone comes close with its performance ..with its 5.5 screen 1 Chipset - Exynos 4412 Quad CPU - Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 2 Super AMOLED capacitive Touchscreen 3 16GB Internal Memory 4 GPU: Mail-400MP 5 Stylus Pen 6 2GB RAM 7 NFC ,s beam and the list continues more on and on .. The camera quality is up to the mark not so exceptional but pretty decent when it comes to samsung phones related to some saying that it's a pretty big phone fuzz ... guys it's all on individual vision . personally i have been using for 2 weeks and i am almost used to it .. it feels normal to me grip is perfect for me and it fits in my hand perfectly no problem while typing or any operation and if some has small hand samsung has taken care of with its one handed operation features . -coming to battery ..this is where no ones can touch this beast .. it's 3100 mah probably 2nd highest battery in the smart phone category ..it lasts for 28 to 30 hours for me with very ease and if i use less it lasts about 2 days -u will definitely be blown away by the touch-wiz features given by samsung namely -Quick glance -smart stay -s note (most useful ) with s pen -direct call and many more .and it's u i is buttery smooth i didnt notice any lag after installing many apps and games -internal provided after the partition by os is around 11 gb which is more than enough to install your apps and games -Super amoled hd screens adds cherry to its performance .. watching video in this 1080 p is a ever lasting fun Guys if u have this much money to buy this phone just dont think twice just go for it .. if not than don't complain about this awesome phone ..it has every little bit to complete your daily as well as your tedious task and lastly many thanks to flipkart services delivered the product before the expected date with proper packing ... thumbs up for flipkart and its service","before buying this phone i was using s3 .I will be writing review of note 2 in comparission to S3 . I was not sure whether to buy note 2 or continue using s3 .i read lot of reviews on youtube , checked phones at mobile show rooms and finally decided to buy note 2 . I tell u , this is best phone with best features .its processor is much faster than s3 . camera quality is also good . battery back up is excellent . on paper its ppi is less than s3 and many other phones , but in reality the screen quality is excellent . samsung has used RGB technology with great care which makes screen look more clear and vibrant . only thing which goes against note 2 is its size . But i tell u once u start using , after 2-3 days u will not find this phone big . and any phone which is bigger than 4\" , cannot be used with one hand . u have to use both hands . buy this phone , u will definitely enjoy .","First of all this is my first Android phone and i am lucky i chose this one. I was very much confused whether to go for S3 or Note 2. Many people commented that note is bigger and not easy to handle. But trust me it is not that big and easily fits into my pockets. And the best part of it is the features it provides when you compare with S3 like S-Pen along with Airview which is tremendously helpful while browsing web. Also this Screen is best for watching movies and reading E-Books.Finally the huge battery stands for me atleast 3 days with minimal usage.","An excellent phone and tablet hybrid with a superior screen and skill with improved stylus, but its size may still put people off... These reviews has only touched on some of the features that make the Note 2 so useful. Useful is a good description for the Note 2 as it is easily the best phone I have ever used. It's certainly not for everyone, which is true for any smartphone, but for those looking for an innovative phone in the crowded Android space the Note 2 is worth a look...","it has indeed been a great blessing for me to move out of my useless and stone age BB ( i had world edition and curve) to this amazing phone, well seems i am in jet age, mails work fine, social networking and huge amount of aps pls go for it if u can, even better than apple","Ok so it's about 3 weeks I've been using this fabulous phone. I find it among the most powerful handsets in the market at the moment. The OS Android 4.1 Jelly Bean on board makes the device part of a really privileged club of gadgets, Beating the latest version of the Google mobile OS. The S Pen has also made quantum leaps compared to its predecessor..Awesome. All in all, the Samsung Galaxy Note II ticks many of the right boxes and deliver as great an experience as its international version. Normally, we'd say that's an offer you shouldn't miss, but given that the Galaxy Note II is also among the most expensive devices on the Indian market. Only disadvantages I see: Large size makes single-hand operation a bit problematic. Adobe has removed support on Jelly Bean so nothing wrong with the device however Flash currently does work. Doesn't have FM Radio. All Plastic Body.","Its been six days I have bought and I proudly say that SAMSUNG has just done awesome job inventing the NOTE 2. Everything which I wanted in smartphone this is it . Faster web browsing & downloading, incredible 8 MP camera, pop up browser & video player is too great, large shiny screen makes people stare at my smartphone, most creativity stuff the S pen. I would really recommend to those planning to buy this smartphone....just go & get it guys !!! :)","If you want a awesome and beautifully built and designed phone go for iphone 4/4s/5 not 3g/3gs they are friggin ugly!!!! if you want a beast go for samsung galaxy series its got performance and everything but it comes with a cheap looking plastic back but again its useful because it is shock absorbent hence your phone wont be damaged that easily especially a s3 it can withstand heat,water,drops,scratches everything!!!!","Got it in one day. The most amazing gadget in my life. Has everything, all pros no cons. Its so amazing device. I have more than 200 apps, 5000 songs, 20 HD movies, yet glides with performance.

Mass storage is not available, which results in low transfer speed. And you cannot connect this device to a macbook.

Kudos to Flipkart for keeping up their standards. As for the phone, buy it to admire it!!!

WAITING FOR FLIPKART TO CHANGE THE STATUS TO \"AVAILABLE\".. IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH A NON-HANDY PHONE... BLINDLY GO FOR IT... EVEN THE PRICE SEEM TO BE NOT TOO HIGH..

ITS NOT SUCH A WASTE TO PAY FOR NOTE 2 INSTEAD OF A BITTEN APPLE...","i am using my note 2 from last 19 days it's a real beast .before this note 2 i used many smart phones but this is giving me a whole new experience. I'm loving it. first i thought it would be big but after getting hands on it feel's small.it easily fits in my pocket. i bought i from flipkart it,s an awesome experience shopping with them flipkart is the most trusted site it is no.1 in india.it's service is too good.","I purchased it a couple of days back from Flipkart. Two days of usage led me to write \"It ROCKS\". The positives are: 8MP camera with LED; stunning S-pen; Easy user interface; Smart stay operates in coordination with eye blink); Multitasking (available after firmware upgrade); and Air view. The negatives are: Lack of preloaded document editor especially polaris office (may be available in future) and slippery rear cover. The suggestions are: A 4-4.8\" mobile with such a technology may be a fabulous one. The end point is, it's AWESOME","I own a SGS3 And a HTC ONE X . I have also Used Galaxy NOTE and NOTE -2 . The phablet sure does have Killer Specs. But The con is the larger screen that has been made LONGER and less BROADER. From Personal Usage I say This that U mostly about 90% of the times Drop down the NOTIFICATION BAR... to check message updates , turn on wifi, adjust brghtness, bluetooth etc. etc. etc. The size Of the Phone makes using It Irritating at times Coz u Got to use both Hands Simultaneously.... Owning a SGS3 beforehand I did not find the Phone WOW in looks... It was Average for me... The features of both Samsung Note -2 and SGS3 phones are excellent as well as handy. The bigger display Of NOTE -2 surely does Enhance the Internet and the Multimedia Experience. The only con Of this phone I mentioned Above.... I wud Conclude by saying that If u are Looking for an upgrade for ur phone.. Then personally Use both SGS3 and NOTE -2 and decide for urself only on basis of Size... oderwise both are excellent phones.... Cheers Guys Neeraj","Samsung Mobiles are Crap , I purchased Galaxy Note, It used to get Red hot, so hot that i would have lost my ears if i had used it more than 3 mths, i sold it , u know what i sold it at a loss of 7000/- . from 32000 to 25000 in flat 2 mths or so. Samsung u will repent for this. When indians lose there money no company can stay here, u are off now samsung. Next like a utter fool i thought may be coz of big size this must have got hot and i was a die hard samsung follower, so lets give it a benefit of doubt so i purchased again you know what SAmsung S duos recently just 2 mths back it is lauched just like S3 design. Now listen my story carefully, in 1st day i could not hear properly simple calls. I started my speaker on for just listening to other person on phone, whole world was also listening to me. I said ok lets boost the speakers downloaded \"Sound Booster \" app from andriod it helped a bit. Then while simple apps and multitasking , lagging started in phone , such was the lag effect that i used to pause for 10 secs for every command i entered what a waste of time, simple search of contacts was taking time of more than 8-10secs. Shit phone. Sold it a loss , again i am fooled from 17500 - 14000 , a loss of 3500 again Total loss 10,000/- and pain in my mind , i felt cheated by samsung The whole world should know this dump this samsung and korean giant right now or else more innocent peoples hard earned money will get lost . like mines. Say yes to Sony and No to samsung now. I am a certified Flipkart Buyer u can check. Whatever i have written is word worth in gold. Lastly i Thank FLIPKART for everything they did for me in atleast trying there best to resolve my issues. Flipkart tere jaise yaar kahan....","GALAXY NOTE 1 WAS A BIG HIT NO DOUBT, BUT IS IT GOING TO BE THE SAME ? WELL THE PHONE IS SLIGHTLY HEAVIER THEN THE PREDECESSOR AND HAS REALLY LOW PIXEL DENSITY AS COMPARED TO S3 OR NOTE 1. I GUESS ONE SHOULD WAIT FOR PRICES TO GET SLIGHTLY LOWERED AND THIS WILL PROVE OUT TO BE A GREAT BUY. I STILL THINK S3 IS QUIET BETTER AS IT FITS IN HANDS QUIET EASILY AND 4.8 INCH IS REALLY BIG! NOTE 2 HAS A BETTER BATTERY (3000 MAH)BUT I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS ENOUGH FOR SUCH A GIANT MACHINE. WELL I LEAVE IT YOU MY FRIENDS WHETHER YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THIS BEAST OR NOT, I WOULD SUGGEST TO WAIT FOR PRICES TO GET DROPPED! CHEERS, Tanmay Tiwari","Hi All, This is my second review after LG G2. Friends first of all no phone is perfect . I have tried 3 good phones in a month and trust me I switched back to one of phone which I used during the month. I am always a fan of LG . I like LG UI and phones . Now a days we can see people are using Samsung mobile phones so it\u2019s an automatic perception that Samsung phones are good as most of the people are using. My friend told me to go for Note 2 but being a fan of LG G2 and recently I have a hands on LG G2 So I planned to Buy LG G2. Trust me It\u2019s a very good phone with Graphics , UI , Remote , Gaming experience also a good battery life with 10 hours of heavy usage. I used to travel from Ghaziabad to Gurgaon which is almost 2 hours journey and during that time I use to play games , chat , talk etc \u2026.. The very Bad experience with G2 was it lags , every time I have to used task killer or clean application to free memory and ram . Since I used iPhone with IOS 6 for an one year so compare to iPhone and a normal user this phone lags during opening , call connecting , call pick .. it\u2019s not as smooth as I was expecting from this phone \u2026 The lags are too high if it\u2019s one time in a day then I would never have been changed this phone but it lags a lot. So I tried another phone which is called smartphone of the year HTC ONE. Trust me this was the phone which fulfill my topmost requirement . I used for 10 days with heavy games and usage . trust me this phone never lags however the HTC sense automatically manage the CPU and RAM . I do not need to install third party to clean CPU and RAM. This is the one of the phone which competes my old iPhone. Thanks HTC for making a fabulous UI and performance. The camera is good not better but having lots of good feature. I should also talks about the beat audio . Boss this rocks everyone in my team used to listen music on my phone . Awsonw sound with bass and tweeter . It remember the old Sony handsets in 2006 having good sounds. No phone is in the market which can beat HTC sound and performance . But as I told not everything is perfect . This phone bigger drawback is battery drain issue . It last for 6 to 8 hours max usage but if you are listening songs only then it will last for a day . I have to charge twice in a day to use the phone . Just because of battery drain issue I switched to another phone Note 2. The decision was tough as I never want to be part of Samsung family because of ugly UI but I purchased this phone from flipkart. This was my biggest mistake which I regret always. Note 2 no doubt a good phone with lot of features , excellent battery backup ( HTC one : Note 2) ( 70:100) ration , Excellent camera. But but but it lags badly as soon as you started downloading the apps into the phone if there are less apps then this phone will work amazing but my dear friends you spend 30 K on phone so at least you except fair performance. The Samsung UI is ugly , Lags during the call, opening contacts it lags for a friction of seconds . connecting a call is difficult , hangs while picking up the call\u2026Hangs with heavy games . It was very embarrassing movement that you are in a public and you are unable to pick a phone as it stucks\\ lags \u2026 Trust me my friends. My colleagues don\u2019t started believing me but I showed them the problem . They are formatted my phone as per their process but even though it lags. The user experience which I have receive from HTC one an android phone was unbelievable. So I sold this phone and switch back to HTC one once again. For battery issue I have everyday power bank which helps me a lot . During 18 hours of journey I switched off my data service and this phone give me backup of complete 1.5 days I bought this phone after reading reviews on flipkart which helped to make wrong decision so friends request all of you if any phone having any single issue then please share your views. For you it may be hardly matters but for others it matters a lot. Regards Ramesh Yadav","You guys have gone blind. These smartphones are not at all useful . What will you do after you buy this phone ? You're gonna play for a week with its awesome features,try some games etc etc. And soon samsung releases a Galaxy S4 which will be even more awesome than this phone. And soon,apple,nokia and they keep coming and you will feel this phone will suck. And these processors will stop working in a few months. They even lag. So,go for a phone which is around 10-15k which never change. You will be satisfied . 36K for a mobile ? Are you kidding me ? Seriously you can buy a Bike or a car in EMI. You can buy a HD tv , AC . And more useful,the money you put in here will be enough for your college fee for an year. And if you have more money and you dont know what to do,donate them somewhere else. But dont buy these phones .","WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG LONG TIME........... HIGHEST SPECIFICATION ANDROID DEVICE TILL DATE............. BOUGHT IT FROM SAMSUNG INDIA E-STORE WITH PRE BOOKING OFFER...... A MUST BUT...........","There is problem in phone it will hang and the case will also open. Samsung is only ofr name shake other wise i have not found any thing good in this phone when compare to gionee elife s5.5.","My first Note 2 went dead on an overseas trip causing great inconvenience. I thought that was an anomaly and bought a second as a backup. Now both phones are giving me trouble connecting to the WiFi. I get the message \"Your internet connection is unstable\" when other phones, including Samsung Galaxy Note 2 are connecting without problems. I doubt whether I will buy a Samsung mobile phone again.","It is a good performer phone from Samsung. Big screen with stylus helps to make good use of tasks like note-taking, photo-editing, etc. It is helping me to keep the meeting notes handy and quick. I would say it is worth the penny I spent on it.

I use my Note II at least 4 hours per day. This phone is absolutely fantastic. It's like Samsung took everything there was wrong with the S III (not that there were many things, the S III is also truly a fantastic device), fixed it, and named it Note II. The software that it comes with is astounding, the S Note application is absolutely amazing and powerful. The features that Sammy packed are just too many to count, really. Keep it short: no words can describe this device. If you're in dilemma and you're wondering if you should get it, get it. I had the same dilemma and I don't regret my decision for a split second.","Best buy in this price range. Forget SIII, HTCs, Xperias. Using this phone is an 'Experience'. If there's any cell which has a CLASS and stands out in the crowd after iPhones, its got to be Samsung Galaxy Note II.","This Phone has everything thst you have ever wished for, and you are occupied for the next 1 year too... as the features are far more advanced that you wont feel outdated till summer 2014. Handling is a bit of problem, i have dropped it several times even with my beast hands, so if u have kitten paws... think thrice before buying. S-pen is blessing and its humungous screen size with 267 ppi gives you a very good feel. Though some of you may find a bit problem of white flash line occuring during screen unlock( that can be ignored.. but its annoying), but it can be dealt with. This is a timeless phone .. you buy it today and be updated till summers 2014, as it will surely surpass iPhone 5s or 6 for sure( if Tim Cook's Apple did the job they did with iPhone 5). Worth a buy, as their is no market competitor for this Phablet !!!","The world has not seen any better smartphone yet. This this is enormous! beautiful and makes a statement that none can match! Plus, it survived all the drop tests even from the heights of about 6 feets flat on face! Youtube it! Got it a few days ago and being a techie, i'd go with 5 stars for this product. for it's graphics capabilities (OClocked mali 400 GPU) and speed 1.6 GHZ QUAD!!!! you cant just get any wrong! if i had more 40 grands to spare, i'd have got this again! just for the love of it! looks amazing and works superbly! Highly recommended for the guys with average hands. small hands wont like it since it is BIG. but is absolutely perfect for many like me with average to big palms! if you're in a fix between IP5 and this...!! you already know the answer! I don't use my laptop anymore after i got this superb device! Do not forget to get a GENUINE flip covers with this! that makes it even more amazing!","This is the first time I felt like writing a review for a Mobile.I have used many smartphone(I guess) but .....none came close to this.

And Friends this review I am writing using styLus and it is just astonishing how beautifully it translates and understand my worst handwriting. Guys just go for it u will not regret","No doubt its the best phone in market now.But 40k is little costly. Though price drop is already started some website offering 37905/ already.Hope it will reflect in flipkart also. The designer flip cover is coming with it or not is another question.Cos that can difference 2k almost.","You'll regret after few days for buying this crappy slate. Trust me its very difficult to use this as a phone. I would recommend to buy a decent tablet which is available between 10 to 15k and a good smart phone for daily use. Check out the Windows mobiles available in market or wait for the amazing Lumia's (620, 820 and 920) lined up. Thank you ;)","No really impressed with the quality/performance. There is always a lag in the display. I used to buy SONY ERRICSON and HPLC phones. Samsung Galaxy Note has only higher specification. In terms of user friendliness, I think Sony phones are much better. It is an OK phone. Not worth the price.","I am not a samsung hater or an apple hater as my parents own a iPhone 5 and S3, and I have a iPod Touch 5 as I'm just 14, but your review was completely biased and pointless and WRONG. You Said: God has a new Name - Note-2 Mistrio'fab \"Day Counting\", No shit,straight to d point :D Mega Pro's :- 1) Gigantic Processor 1.6 Quad (Apple 5 :- 1Ghz Dual n slow as grand pa) ME: Iphone 5 has an A6 (1 GHz Dual Core) but it is iOS optimised so it gives a much more fluidic performance than even 1.6 Quad core. 2) 2 Gig Ram to Kill Any app made on this earth or other dimension or even by GOD himself .(Apple 5 :- Still wid 1 gig n lags behind benchmark) ME: Apple has apps (much more than Android app store) specially made for it so it can handle any app from iTunes easily. 3)Mali 400 can run any graphic intensive app like butter, wid no hang or lag or stuck or whatsoever like in Apple. ME: Play FIFA 13, oops android doesn't have it yet, so go play FIFA 12. You'll open your eyes to an apple wonder. 4)S-Voice ,can do whatever u command, weather/Call/Text/Alarm/meeting etc. no limit. ME: Siri, much ahead than S-Voice, though S-Voice is killer too. 5)S-Pen ,Still d King;Still Incomparable. Wid Air View ,10 yrs ahead of so called Apple. ME: iPhone's screen is so easy to handle that your thumb can do wonders. 6)Battery :- it lasts for 3-4 days if u just uses it for Call on WCDMA/GSM . Playing games is in ur list then it would last for a day. ME: Your on the spot with that though iPhone has the same call. Cons :- 1) Still Looking for con's ,sorry but there isn't Any. ME: Size, for some it is very uncomfortable to hold. Screen, Samsung still has to improve a lot on the screen resolution and pixel density. VERDICT :- When you buy a Lamborghini u don't see how much gas it cost u ,how d long it will give u mileage or whatsoever. You buy it for Speed > Passion > Madness > Status. The same applies in Note:-2 ,If u gat 40 grand in ur pocket n still looking to buy an another shit of Apple as A5 or other, then my friend i would like to give FREE Advice \"Galaxy Note -2 is a performance oriented wid futuristic apps wid massive 5.5 inch screen, where Apple sell on only hype wid Grand pa IOS, Tiny Screen,crappy battery life wid no open source. ME: iPhone is so good you won't miss open source and you'll obviously look much better carrying iPhone to your office rather a phone made for the young. Overall, Note 2 is an absolute buy but if you are office going or like your phone to be update or as a status symbol, go for iPhone.","I just hate the phone ..I just HATE IT..First time I hold the phone It was a really disgusting experience. Its Massive I cant even hold it with my one hand ...My sister was laughing the way I was holding it with two hands..She said baap re !..Really, phones should not be that big..Next the purpose of making such big screens is solely for watching videos...Now that is where I doubt their talent...Its a DISGUSTING DISPLAY. SUPERRR AMOLED = crap. Started pain after watching a clip for few minutes. Trust me its an eye killing device...I cud not believe it bcoz I have a samsung monitor led which is the best in the display quality ...Seriously I am writing this review to aware people with sensitive eyes specially children and youngsters..buy it only to bcome blind(I was feeling it) or if u want headache(my sister was feeling it)..All apps movies photos ...all exciting is gone when u look at the device ...If I have been granted a God wish I will destroy AMOLED display machine. NEXT, 30k + and cheap plastic back cover..? Are we that dumb or samsung dont have any class ! The materials used is the key area where devices price jump and customer choose the best out of the lot..In my opinion this plastic phone should thrown in the trash the moment we pick it up...In this area , I feel Samsung is really STEALING OUR MONEY. Next, unpolished apps..os..lags sometimes..os not efficiently uses cpu's power Finally , Pros : ------ Exynos 4 : performance but os cant capitalize it Android : Lot of free apps..many are crappy apps but free apps..so go and download free crappy apps Pen : Solely made for office purpose..very useful ..USP for the product Cons : (Lots of) --------------------- Design & Aesthetics : Either samsung don't have class ( Samsung dont know how to make great product) OR they are STEALING money by selling plactics (Making huge money) Display : DEADLY in terms of Quality..It may seriously harm ur eyes and cause u headache ! Size : Dinosaur of phones ..Its truly not a phone its phablet crap. Apps : Unpolished , jaggy, laggy, and feels crappy Price : I feel they are robbing the world by selling CHEAP plastic intentionally..I think they have made a profit of a billion $ from it..Moreover when U go to service centers if product have no warranty..the biggest illiterates, idiots, clowns and rascals charge u same as if a doctor charges in metro cities SAMSUNG IS THE BIGGEST FRAUD IN SMARTPHONE INDUSTRY. NEVER EVER BUY SAMSUNG ! I cant give -ve points so 1 star... Or Blackberry Z10 or Q10 ABSOLUTE BEST CHOICE !","I given my old phone Sony Ericsson back to shop and took this smart phone with 26,650/-RS, including Screen guard and Flip cover free.So I compared all phones which has 40k ranges with different brands seems I felt this one is worthy by exchange offer. of course I am enjoying with this phone now. Specification are near to 3 years old tp.","for all of u complaining about price hike done by flipkart , go check samsung india site . the price of the phone has now increased from 35500 to 37380. since the phone is now more xpensive , flipkart has nothing to do with it . its the same for the samsung galaxy s3 , it 2 has become xpensive now .. the prices of these 2 phones have just increased . go check latest prices on http://www.samsung.com/in/consumer/mobile-phone/mobile-phone/smartphone/","Pros: 1) Big screen hence watching movies is a treat 2) Very Fast but can't compare it to the iphone 5 in terms of speed 3) Lots of features and apps available in google play 4) Battery Life (lasts me 2 days on 3g,30 minutes of web surfing, 3 email accounts with close to 300 mails per day, bluetooth, gps n all) Cons: 1) Camera, does not automatically adjust to the surroundings, hence have to do it manually, for indoors and low visibility. 2) Screen goes blank after the set screen timeout when viewing flash videos in full screen. 3) Zoom feature is good but lags at times.","this phone is very very nice. but is of no use this is a machine this can play many video simultaneously, But we humans are not machine to watch all videos. very huge to handle. if u can handle large phone than buy tab 2","The phone in itself is a gorgeous piece of device.However, it has nothing innovative to offer. I would recommend the Lumia 920 for anyone in this price range as its probably the best phone on the market right now","SAMSUNG provides the worst quality service i have ever seen.if you buy product & you find any defect in product after week or 4 days they are not gonna replace your mobile or they will not replace the defective part till you get exhausted.","@Anup Kumar, It is unfair to compare iphone 4/5 with samsung because samsung loose big time. Don't go bt the specs along. i phone has been designed to last world war 3 but the samsung, I am afraid, cant be expected to do so. Drop the samsung and i phone and the display of the samsung will be out within no time. Plus i phone is all about posh looks and Standard, which i am afraid the Samsung is light years behind. Every tom dick and harry can afford a samsung but only few blessed can ever afford an i phone. All samsung models are copies of i phone or Nokia or Blackberry. My friend had a Samsung S2 wich went from bad to dead in just under 6 months. And the after sales service experience proved even worse. The lamborgini in the comparison is the i Phone and the Samsung is worth no more than a farm Tractor with a beefed up engine and transmission. Sorry Samsung !!!","I must warn you before buying any HTC phone! The kind of service I have received is absolutely shocking considering it is such a big brand! In the past 1 year that I have owned my htc desire z, I have had to give it for servicing 2 times. First time they took a month to repair and the second time, I went to collect it after almost 2 months, and while checking the phone at the service center, it started giving a completely new problem!! So had to give it back immediately for another repair!! Their network is so bad that nobody knows what is the status of the phone. They have outsourced their front-end service to the most useless people who never cooperate. The customer care is just some call center who sweet-talk you into believing you will get the phone while the actual service center is somewhere in Bangalore and everyone bluntly refuses to provide the contact number for that!! I have wasted so much time & money on making calls trying to follow up and I have even had to go till their higher management but its of no use... If you are buying htc, then you're just asking for trouble.","Its a great phone, but Samsung should release the 64GB variant at the earliest. Many more people will buy if it is released with 64GB internal memory. I hope 64GB variant comes soon. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .","No doubt its great but the same brand Samsung is providing Galaxy s4 mini in 27k with the same specification as the Note 2, only the difference is, that the Note 2 is having a large 5.55 inch HD screen whereas the S4 mini has a 4.27 inch qHD screen and Note 2 is having 1.6 GHz quad core processor and S4 mini is having 1.7 GHz dual core processor. And despite of that, S4 mini has 42 mbps 3G speed whereas Note 2 gives 21 mbps 3G speed. So, why to buy Note 2 ?????????, buy S4 mini of the same brand SAMSUNG. Note 2 ----------------------------------------------------------------- S4 mini 1.6 GHz quad core -------------------------------------------------1.7 GHz dual core HD display -------------------------------------------------------------qHD display 2 GB of RAM-----------------------------------------------------------1.5 GB RAM 21mbps HSDPA ------------------------------------------------------42mbps HSDPA Rs. 37000 ---------------------------------------------------------------Rs. 27000 So, why to pay 10000 rupees extra only for 0.5 GB of RAM and 2 cores. And S4 mini has a great 3G speed ???????????? Buy a Samsung S4 mini insted of Samsung Note 2.","Overall a good phone. However, price is very very high. With 40k you can do lots of things. :P:P Like: 1. Plan a travel tour with friends or family 2. Can buy a bike. 3. Can buy a car on emi's. 4. Donate that money to the needy one and buy a cheaper phone instead. 5. Buy a HD LED TV. 6. Buy an AC. So its up to you whether you gonna waste that 40k for just a phone with which you get bore some in a few months or do the things that have been described above.","I'm a first time user of Android and Samsung devices. I must say that I'm happy with the device so far. Device is pretty snappy, thanks to good hardware specs and JellyBean. What I like: - Device is pretty snappy - Customisations ( I did tons of customisations using tasker and other apps). - Google integration - Handwriting - Large screen What I don't like: - Default android phone app. This is my biggest concern. You don't get a concise view of phone logs, SMS app UI is very mediocre). All that you can see is one line when you start replying to a mail though you have such a big screen) I don't like most: - Power buttons on the right side of the device. You \"accidentally\" restart the device 2-3 times minimum while holding the phone. - Volume buttons on the left. You can hardly access them if you replace the back cover with the flip cover. - No mute button. Its hard to press the touch screen every time you want to mute the line.","i got it from a samsung retailer . 2 peices for me and my friend . my phone hangs often and comes in box with android v4.0 ICS and touchwiz makes the experience even poor. looks like using a s duos . it is just too big as a phone an comes wit great specifications an mammoth battery . i would suggest to go for an iphone 4s or 5 . atleast you get good phone , great apps and good specifications and nor a plastic toy with processor and speed . now a new case arrives the touch responds after 3 seconds . told samsung . they say nothing can be done . they want an addititional rs 8000 for repair . never even given the phone a bump . what further no jelly bean upgrade on even my friend's phone who gets v2.3 out of the box . dont buy note 2. it is not a good phone and not worth it .","When is the dal SIM version coming out? In India Dual SIM is th only option to manage mobile bills and manage official and personal calls. Looking forward to a dual SIM version with a lower price ofcourse as the current price is too high. After all a 42\" HDTV cost is currently the same price as the 5.5\" inch mobile. I postponed my high-end phone purchases and insted went in for 2 HDTV's in both bedrooms. Children are now on full time entertainmen fun with PS3, Tata Sky HD Plus, etc..","according to me a product's main aspect is its design and this is thedepartment where samsung lags behind.the basic diiference in terms of appearence b/w grand ,S3 and note 2,and coming S4 is the screen size.otherwise they all look same.a costly product with cheap plastics..in terms of performance samsung is good but if a product is not good from outside then why look for inside.. cons:- Very poor design very large display. doesn't appeal as an expensive phone..","Guys, If you see Samsung's tactic in India they make Cell Phone and after 6 months to 1 year you can see so much offers and discounts on the item as they will be planning to lunch a new Phone again. If you compare the Samsung S4 Price in US to India its so much difference in Price there.And withing 2 months only S4 has decreased its price by 2000/-.Some rubbish going on. Imagine the Samsung S3 Price when it was lunched in India it was around 38K. On Present day you can get it at 27K. 11k difference,you can't rechage talktime of 11l in 1-1.5 years.

After going through manual and speaking to samsung, I came to know that handset is compatible with Micro sim card only. But, I use different phones on different occasions by inserting the same sim card. But, If I cut my sim card for Note-2, it will be limited to note-2 only, will not be able to use the same in another phone. Listing did not mention anything about \"Micro sim card\". Flipkart should have stated the facts in product listing. I have, therefore, returned the product. Will buy Samsung Galaxy Note which is compatible with normal sim card.","hate it please dont buy it its the worst device on this earth touching sensors are very very poor camera is the worst quality not a single app gets downloaded i m sucked....... warning : dont buy it.......","wastage of money phone you find a nice from nokia company and with no of features in it.And also Nokia much reliable then sumsung......................

Honestly speaking I do know that note 3 is bigger and has better specs and a better stylus and all that but note 2 has ideally screen size and enough specs for all the required operations. I will go to the extent that it's the gadget of the decade.","I am writing this review after using this phone more than 1 year. Such a sturdy phone, you play high end games, watch videos, do multitasking there was no evidence of lagging. It is a bundle of entertainment. After kitkat update I feel someone put cream on my UI.

Still it is smoothly going fine, whether it is browsing , videos or audio. I like the quality of audio very much. Though I am not a gamer, i noticed that any kind of sophisticated game would run smoothly. The specs are still relevant after two years of releasing. This phone is a good combination of multimedia and multitask capabilities. Video quality is excellent, however image quality can be improved though it makes decent photos, in my opinion. You can get almost all the facilities from this phone which are offered in the latest high end phones. No doubt that this phone is a good option in mid range quality phones.","yes it is too handy and i liked it very much. if you have a 3g connection and lots of data balance then this phone just rocks. listening to videos and audios wearing headset gives nice theater feeling. most amazing part is the s pen..","Fast processing, feature rich, nice battery power managment,worth buying.Only in term of weight its not that light weight, but ok, since all other fetaures are very good.","Bought this phone on Flipkart and have been using it for the last 6 months.

Still lot to explore :)","Hi Flipkart, I have Nokia N73 and would like to go with current offer no Note-2 but it is not listed. Can you please confirm. Thanks Manendra","I bought Galaxy Note II about three weeks ago from Flipkart. On exchange offer with my old Nokia phone. Cash-on-delivery. Excellent service, fast delivery. Very professional. Very impressed and satisfied with the phone. The stylus-based S-pen feature is very good, which is my reason for buying the phone. I have yet to fully get used to the phone and all its features which are plenty. I could not find a detailed user manual/guide on the web which covers everything about the phone, and so, getting to know and fully getting used to the phone is taking time. As a serious business user, I feel that such a manual would have been very useful in many ways. Without the S-pen feature, I would not have chosen this phone, but would have preferred a windows 8 phone. If there were a windows 8 phone with built-in Wacom digitizer and S-pen-like facility, I would have certainly preferred it over the Galaxy Note II. Upgraded memory to a total of 80 gb - 16 gb of the phone, and 64 gb of Class 10 Sandisk MIcroSD card, also bought from Flipkart. Works very well. The back-cover of the battery compartment is incredibly delicate! Can't believe that Samsung could not give us a sturdier back for such an expensive phone. This applies also to the Samsung Flip cover which I did not buy because it replaces the existing cover with a back made of the same material - no enhanced protection. Pros: Excellent phone with generous amount of rich and useful features. Excellent display. Very good battery life. Excellent S-pen feature with Wacom digitizer. Cons: Poor quality back cover (battery compartment) of questionable protection value. No manual/user guide to cover all aspects of this feature-rich incredibly good phone.","Samsung Galaxy Note 2! Yes it is Note 2 and after lot of ifs, buts and thought process coupled with storming sessions with my friends and family members, I decided it has to be note 2 or else people must be fool to give 5 stars and reviewing the said product more than so many times. I was using Samsung Omnia W I8350 and gave it in exchange and additional 10% cash back for using one private bank's credit card and the final price was Rs 24,750/-!!! Would you believe it!!! Its a stunning deal with an amazing phone in your hand and guess what, the phone was already updated to Android 4.3! No questions asked, Flipkart's delivery is awesome folks. 3 day delivery for a normal delivery thingy is one thing which will blow you apart. Pros: The battery back up is awesome and I am not gonna write any other pro as it is already mentioned on the website for over 1000 times. Cons: Little big on your hands. Its a must buy for all those folks who are looking for a phone under 30k. Final verdict: Go for it. Thank you Sachin!","Simply Superb i am loving every moment with this...flipkart is even faster than quickrrrr in delivery the product..!! :P Hats off to all you guys out there...","This is one hell of a gadget. It is the best product I currently use. The screen is simply beautiful, speed is excellent, and it feels luxurious with the glowing screen and heavy feel. I use it for all sorts of things and it never fails you. Battery is awesome, for the first few days I practically spent all day using it, testing it, downloading apps etc. and there's always at least 20-30% battery left at night after 16+ hours of heavy use. I happily spent 600 Euros to buy it, and that was very good value, in fact the price of this phone should not compare to other smart phones out there, as this is a different product, it truly is a phone and a tablet in one (so the alternative is buying 2 items for double the price). I am not a so-called Apple hater, but the iPhone is a toy next to this one(I used the iPhone 5 for 3 days); even the Galaxy S3 is reduced to a toy next to it. Samsung could easily sell it for additional 30% in price (at least to those who appreciate it). One comment about the size: you buy this phone specifically for its size, I wonder how some reviews mention its size as a disadvantage or a con how can that be when you bought it BECAUSE of its size not in spite of it? Don't hesitate about it, buy it IF you need a bigger screen. If the size to you is an obstacle then stick to the smaller ones, as this is not intended to be just another phone, it's intended to be a personal assistant, tablet, and phone. I recommend it without hesitation, and would like to thank Samsung for making such a beautiful product","As usual prompt and quick delivery. It was my first exchange offer purchase and didn't expect that it would work so smoothly. Final price with exchange and card discount came out to be much cheaper than retail offers. There are enough reviews about the product - so I won't write additionally on it. Product was received in very good condition and works well.","This is an awesome phone..Really its worth buying! :) I bought this phone with the reviews which i found in Flipkart. All reviews were really helpful to choose this awesome phone. But i am not fully satisfied with the product which i received. I am talking about the manufacturing defect. The first piece i received had its left side of its screen bulging outside. I report this issue and got replaced the product soon. But the problem is that, the product which is replaced is also having the some screen issue. The left side of the screen is pressing little up and down. at times the screen bulges outside a very little..i would say very little. That would not be a serious issue. But when i spent a substantial amount to buy a phone like this, it really matters. But apart this small manufacturing defect, rest everything is super awesome!!! May be just this piece i got has this issue!! Not blaming flipcart and the seller. They did really good job. Received the product on time. Thanks a lot!! ................................. I got my issue cleared and the phone is working well! recently i got 4.4.2 update too!","This review is totally based on Usage after a months time with the Note 2. 1.This set Never hangs ( i did`nt find any force closes or lags or force restarts ) 2.Have played HD games like Modern Combat 4, Nova 3,Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2(with max settings),Wild Blood, RR3, NFSMW and the game plays have been superb. 3.Camera is good but not the best. Night shots in low light did have grains.Day shots are excellent. Video recording is also great. 4. Android 4.3 Update has made the device even smoother than before. KitKat update scheduled around April 2014 (as per leaked reports on the web) 5.Net surfing is a pleasure on the sharp and clear HD large Screen and there is absolutely no stutter in the stock browser ,although Chrome at times is a bit jittery but hardly noticeable unless compared to the stock browser. 6.With the 4.3 update Touchwiz is very fluid and responsive 7. Battery life: Now this is totally usage dependent. In my experience with the Note 2 , with about 4 hours of screen time,Voice calls around 2 hrs and some average gaming for around 30 mins or so i get a backup of 12 hours easily and data/wifi remains on. Without Data/wifi i do get around 30 plus hours . Wifi although drains the battery faster IMO. Now not all things are rosy for this Beast of a device. While playing a few graphic intensive games like Real Racing 3 or MC4 the upper back side of the phone heats up ,but since the soc is a quad core powerhouse and makes the phone run buttery smooth and fast this can be overlooked. A day after purchasing this phone , without installing any games or any other 3rd party apps and after clearing the RAM, I ran the Antutu Benchmark on this set and got an impressive score of 21385 ,for a hardware config over a year old. NenaMark 2 gave me a fps of 58. I was confused between the LG G pro and Note 2 and finally settled for this because of the most distinguishing feature ..the S Pen and the Software update to 4.3 Final Opinion : Guys , although the Note 3 is out , this is still a monster of a device and can handle all your daily needs impeccably . And for those Android junkies like me if you want note 3 features just root your device and install the Tigra or the DN3 ROMs and you can enjoy all the software goodies (Air command ,Pen window ,magazine,etc) of the note 3 on your note 2. Cheers ! .","In short - one of the best experience of shopping on line - 48 hour delivery - effortless pick up of old phone and an excellent buyback price for it. Totally satisfied. And the product - Note 2 has improved my working efficiency by almost 50 %.","This is the best mobile from Samsung which has everything in it. \"Classy\" in one word. and working even better with Android 4.3 jellybean update provided by Samsung.And I hear that Kitkat update is also on its way in Jan 2014. Go ahead and buy it guys ! I got it for Rs.27500/- in exchange of my old Samsung mobile from Flipkart.","Its a amazing piece on this price, its so good, U know frnds I always used to change my mobile phone one by one before I got this Note ll, bt now I stay in this phone, and I never change another......","This is the best of smart phone from Samsung. No need to give detailed review as already this devise crossed 5 star rating. But my disappointment is might be I got defective battery with mobile. Coz, I am not using Note 2 as I already have another smart phone. This mobile I am using for personal use only. As per my knowledge, this heavy battery suppose to be at least for 1.5 day. But I am getting only 5-6 hours of back up and in a day I need to charge 2-3 times in a day. I am not happy only for this reason. Else, no other issue I found. If its possible, please re-place the battery, coz I dont have that much of time to visit service center and unable to wait for 2-3 days to resolve this issue. Given 4 star due to defective battery or else, it should be 5............ Good day guys...........","Flipkart has kept up its reputation of offering the best service and good product in the best price. This is a widely adopted phone that has proved its mettle in the market. I bought the phone two weeks back in exchange of my old phone. I have had no issues with the phone so far. Thanks flipkart","It was a nice experience to shop with you. I was shopping for the first time on line. Product reached me at the promised time. It was as i had expected it to be. I will recommend flipkart to all my friend for on line shopping.","I bought this mobile when the exchange offer was going on the website. I gave my old samsung S5570 and i got this mobile at just Rs. 26500. I found the offer and the mobile too good to resist. Samsung galaxy note 2 is after all a long time runner.","Even after arrival of Note 3, Note 2 is a good buy. Display is very nice. Battery Life is average (you will have to recharge almost daily) on average usage. It never hangs. Software will update to 4.3 automatically.","Completely satisfied with the product.Got a great exchange deal and bought couple of other products from the same retailer. Very good experience.","The cell is awwwooossssmmmm but need dual sim.....!!! 5.5 screen -Quad-Core -2GB RAM -Super AMOLED capacitive Touchscreen -16GB Internal -64GB External Expandable -Camera: 8MP(Main), 1.9(Front) -NFC -OS: Android Jelly Bean -GPU: Mail-400MP -Stylus Pen","i purchased this from flipkart, good service from flipkart.. and excellent phone atleast till now.... rest i will update after 1 month about its experience.. :)","Superb Phone. If you are really into smartphones, this is the one that will give you all you need features and functionality. As expected the battery life of Note 2 is amazing. I can stretch it a full day with all the features ON, Bluetooth, Internet & Gaming on average use.","This is by far the best Android device with that price range. Its very fast and has a great battery life. You can go ahead and buy it with confidence. As usual, Flipkart was at its best in delivering it before time.","Everything is so perfect about this phone that I can't seem to find any flaw. It multitasks and handles like a beauty. Perfect!","Just Buyed this phone 2 weeks backs, For Now I found it to be a Excellent Phone, Lighter than I thought, Games are running awesome & Already got the Update for 4.3...","The deal is good for the price tag of around 27-28k after which its not good enough cause Nexus 5 is just arrived!! First of all the most thing is just annoying you is the back panel cover which is too uncomfortable to open with, and seems like the cheap plastic which could not feel you premium class material instead of the glossy looks.so be careful to open this specially with flip cover if using with this. Note 2 doesn't have the Gorilla Glass! Samsung touch wiz is good enough but can't be give you premium looks as much as HTC sence 5.5. Android 4.3 update is now available in india so upgrade it to the latest one and if believe, rumors is positively indicating that this one can get the 4.4 by the April 2014 end. Jumbo battery never let you down for the entire whole day with heavy use like downloading with wi-fi, games etc. Overall is smart phablet but it's little bit hard to carry.","I see a lot of reviews comparing this to the Optimus G Pro. I recently purchased it from here and had to return it due to some manufacturing issues. I then purchased a Note2 instead. In my detailed testing over last week, the Note2 is a much better phablet. For starters, the screen is super clear and pleasing even at 5% brightness. The camera is super clear even at low light without any smudging. The in-build speakers are also very clear and loud outdoors. I updated the device to android 4.3 after buying it and the tablet is even smoother than before. Just remember to factory reset your device before and after the upgrade in order to avoid some bizarre battery problems being reported by folks on the web. The phone also feels light and comfortable to hold and use for long periods of time without even becoming warm. I havent even started exploring all the possibilities of the S-Pen yet but even at 3-5K more than the Optimus, this device is a good buy at least for my usage patterns. I dont think there are any other phablets even close to the capabilities of this device even after 1 year of introduction in the Indian market.","Awesome screen with battery back up. Processor does well to play heavy games. Samsung s phone features rocks. Overall good phone.","i am using it since last 3 months still lot more to discover in it best one of all my previously use phones i suggest to buy","Configuration 10/10 Performance 10/10 Camera 9/10_Due to Great Performance at Day Time and only OK performance at Night time. User Interface 10/10 Value of Money 10/10 Battery Life 10/10 ( lasts for 2 Days In general Usage with Internet by wifi. and for calling 23 Hours total on 2G. ) Other things like Display, Music, Video etc 9.5/10. Main thing in 30,000 it is more then enough for a smart phone.","Good at performance and appearance. I have been Changing mobiles every 2 to 3 months. Now even after using this product for more than 6 months, I have not changed it. The only other product that could match with is Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3. For more details about this product you may visit the website en.wikipedia.org and type Samsung Galaxy Note 2 in the search bar. Happy spending with my beloved friend...","I have been a proud owner of this phablet for the last 4 months and it is a dream mobile. Works like a charm on the most extensive games and all and works with most applications. Battery is great... Just received the update of Jelly Bean 4.3 and it is just awesome now... Guys, dont think... just go for this dream....","This is the best phone I have ever used. Its fast, nice display, SPEN is great for creative work and notes. Sound is good and for watching videos, gaming and reading this is a perfect device. To say about battery , I am a moderate user and it last for more than a day easily. To say, I am a proud owner of Note 2. Pros: 1.6 GHZ quad core exynos A9 SOC is great for gaming and multitasking. ARM Mali-400 MP4 GPU provides good graphics. Supported by 2 GB of ram lag never seen. 3100 MAH battery is great and you can stay away from charger for 1.5 days with moderate use. Display is HD with 1280*720. Nice for videos and gaming and reading as well. 16 GB inbuilt is good but expansion slot is a great addition. Excellent WIFI and 3G reception. Cons: Updates are becoming a problem with Samsung as there is a big delay. Device is still at 4.1.2 JB. As 4.4 KK is out. Who ever uses this will get addicted.. He he.... not sure if its a pro or a con. To sum up, even if Note 3 is out this still is a great deal. Since its expected to get all the basic features of Note 3 , this will never disappoint you. Go For IT guys !!!!","the product is so good and no problems with the product since i have been using it since past 5 months .initially when i bought the mobile there was a delay of getting cashback to be credited in my account but later after so many calls and mails the problem was resolved by the flipkart people!!!However the offers and services provided by them are so good !!overall my rating for the product is 5/5 and for flipkart service is 4/5(bcoz of delay of cashback).","this mobile gives all function which is diffrent from all mobiles like nexus cons; 1.6 Ghz fast processer with 2 gb ram \"very fast\" high capacitive and sensitive to touch extremely amazing camera even secondary camera is very clear","Samsung seemed to be in a hurry to launch Note3 and stopped updation of any kind to the firmware. They could have done better by updating the OS. Also you can install programs only in the internal memory which is of 16GB and fills up pretty fast. Average Buy!","Meets and beats the expectations. Really impressed with the product and also with the timely delivery by seller.","i using samsung galaxy note 2.. its just very good phone with no problems.... i seen it has old tech. it didn't have air view ,air gesture using hands, etc which all got by s4 & note 3. but it is best android phone i have ever seen ... till 2012 .. its works all thats make you impress and got very big . see hd videos very large feels more good experiance..","Bought note 2 . Its breeze on the phone . Good call quality , Better screen . And virtually no lag . Android has lag thats minimal on note 2 . I dont say it doesnt lag totally . However Kudos to flipkart service as usual . Ordered on Saturday afternun and got it on sunday. though they dont work on sunday they delivered this :) . On the phone . I have used this phone extensively havent found any trouble as of now . I trusted flipkart for their service and they didnt upset me . The phone battery rocks . with 20 hours standby and 2.5 hours screen time that too when i started the phone from 50% battery left . Regarding touchwiz its smooth but they could have done better job with customizations though . and on software part its smooth but not the smoothest of all . Note 3 is the smoothest of all . Its defintiely fast and nice to scroll on screen and to be frank the only part I found bad is lack of accessories on indian sites . The amazon US has products like otterbox defender series case . The Ncase I got its good but the problem is I cant put the cover on attach headph on it and listen to song and still keep the cover on . I have to take the phone out of the Ncase cover . The headph is on odd side and the power button shd have been on top rather than being on side . cause while holding the phone inside case lots of times the button gets pressed . But apart from these minor issues the phone quality is superb . Thought plastic is cheap but defintiely the grey brushed one is lot premium in look and feel compared to its white sibling :)","its over one year m using this phone,so far nothing to complain about..just as simple, as it is and as fashionable as one can imagine..........","Worst phones I have ever seen in my life. Strictly not recommended to anyone don\u2019t buy Samsung... Mobiles and services provided by the Samsung are really really bad... worst phones from Samsung...","The product delivery from Flipkart was perfect as usual, but I am not much happy about the quality of the product. I am not sure if it is the same with all Galaxy Note 2 or just a piece defect. The 8 MP camera doesn't seem to capture quality pictures without Flash even in good lighting conditions. Often protests to charge. The 5.5 inch screen makes it slightly uncomfortable for single hand use. Pros The screen seems to really scratch proof. The display is really good. There are very many apps and other features to ponder. The charge lasts for one whole day even with heavy use of 3G. The dual screen functionality helps you multi task. Very useful for playing rhymes and cartoons to your baby while feeding ;-)","Fast delivery by flipcart and gud product by Samsung...Also got two freebies....Overall it's gud feeling for purchasing this product from flipcart.","hey guys, this phone is really awesome. actually its not a phone its a mixture of phone and tablet. i mam using this phone and get impressed by its cool feature. it has 5.55\" inches big screen with full HD. it has quad processor which make this phone very fast. another feature includes its geature and air view feature using s pen. if u really wanna buy this then go for it without any trouble.","This phone has the best battery back-up amongst all the smart p[hones as of today. You can do wonders with this phone. You can save emails n attach emails to your mails and a lot more.","ultimate Phone by Samsung awesome touch, so sensitive WOW its really future proof. real value for money. camera is the best battery backup also good.","I am using Note 2 since 10 months.

Not 4 call lovers...as it is single sim! Its features cannot be described....there is a lot facilities..... Buy it 4 urself and hav the best ever experience of using a smarrttt phone!!!!","First of all I used Acer , samsung duos s and then note 2 android devices .. And with decent knowledge m' writing this review The biggest thing about the note 2 is amoled 2 screen .. the screen comes with not only with Quality it is very smooth to touch .. you can play games , watch movies , do web surf what ever the first thing plays a vital role is screen .. m' really love with this amoled 2 screen .. m' sure amoled 3 will do better job which comes with note 3 and s4 .. The second thing is Speed .. the speed is A9 chip with Quad core so I never find any app till now this phone hands .. i use like about 60 apps but my phone works very smooth .. and its responsive is making me always buying samung products in future note 3 or note 4 and so .. Things like graphics , sound Quality (headset) etc are good not the best but good .. it is very slim and sexy .. dont tell me iphone have Quality and these samsung phones are not .. you can only tell when you really used it for long time .. about smart features ?? Damm samsung tell you very few smart features about the phone .. there are thins like easy swipe to call , best call blocker in the world , and many many features wil take this smart phone to high peak .. if you are person who love things like tools , smart features etc .. this phone is for you . no secondary thought .. for the people who gave 1 star .. m' 100% sure this phone is not for you and you are not eligible for atleast giving reviews .. On considering all features and things Quality m' giving this phone 5 star Dont care about screen guys .. you will feel better while playing games , movies , web surf big screen plays a big role .. so 5.5 is must for a mob .. buy alternate mob some cheap mob for carrying outside like gameplaying etc .. m' really impressed with my note 2 I agree samsung is really poor in giving latest updates .. they do because they want to earn money from their latest mobiles .. I hate samsung for only that reason else everything is fine ..","Feature Vs money, this is the best phone in the market; Before this I have used Galaxy S3, HTC Inspire 4G, Iphone 4S - none is comparable with this. Earlier Price was high, now it's close to 30K, and worth It.","Many reviews are there for this awesome colossal phone yet I thought of writing one. It is highly customisable on the software if you are a root user. I got this phone few months back. Its still a dream set though it is the flagship of 2012. First lets go through its Pros and Cons. PROS: 1)Large display(5.5\" ) with pentile matrix having 3 subpixel per pixel(better clarity) 2)Nice PPI(267) .Though it seems lower than the present full HD phones and also lower than HD phones with smaller screen size the SUPER AMOLED makes up for it heavily. 3)The S pen has many features. May not be useful to some but its fun to have it. 4)Cortex A9 @ 1.6ghz. Breezes through most games with practically no lag, Games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 7 runs without any hiccups. 5)The 8 megapixel snapper at the back does great too. Capable of 1080p and also good quality low light photos.Front camera is bonus with good resolution as well. 6)Multi-window and Smart Rotation adds to the cart as well, Though I didn't use it much , its a good show off I guess(After all you are spending so many bucks on the phone ;) ) 7)Micro sd support upto 64 gb ! Great if you are a MUSIC and FHD videos fanatic, 8)NFC :- Just to be future proof ! 9)2 GB ram - Only the Note 3 betters it as of now. Enough to handle all the bloatwares associated with the TouchWiz addon from Samsung. 10)3100 mah Battery - A big boost. At the time of its release only one of the Motorola Droids had better. CONS: 1)No HDMI port. Though its not an essential , yet many would prefer to see a direct link to the FHD TV's or the UHD TV's now available. 2)Wifi connectivity fiddles when you are more then 4-5 meters away from the router, (Can get irritating at times) 3)Mali 400 gpu and not ADRENO 3xx series. Though this gpu is fast enough , yet it gives a trolled FPS in the AnTuTu Benchmark. Its 3d Score is significantly lower compared to other Androids using the ADRENO Gpus. 4)No metal UNIBODY - Yes definitely its good looking but that plastic finish feels a bit off the premium level. Atleast Design could have been better . Its hard to distinguish for the common flare between a Galaxy Grand and a Galaxy Note 2 from the front. 5)Sound is a bit low. One would prefer docks if one is soundaholic :D. Basically the PROS bury the CONS! The PHONE can be customised heavily. If one is an android root user, then he/she will be delighted with the number of custom roms available for this device. I managed to get an AnTuTu score of 21895 on my custom rom which is better than Sony Xperia Z, (a 2013 flagship phone). The phone doesn't tend to heat up too much. The S note feature is great one with people wanting to take quick notes as the App pops ups when you remove the S-Pen .(You can disable the settings too ) . The sound level is low as a mentioned before , but the in ear headphones gives a nice quality.Video playback is great too. ALL IN ALL THIS IS ONE GEM OF A MOBILE HANDSET. A ONE YOU SURELY WANT TO HAVE AND WON'T REGRET THE BUCKS YOU SPENT ON IT. DEFINITELY , A MUST BUY !!","Pros: 1. big screen (5\") - very convenient to read e-books and watch video contents, the lines don't crumple or overflow to the next line. 2. handy stylus - if you are into note making and occasional writing then this is a phone for you. 3. The Stylus apps are good and the android market has few good apps which utilize the power of it. 4. 3100mAh battery - the battery lasts for 2 days on medium use (internet and apps) and 1 day on extensive use. Cons: 1. Little uncomfortable in your pocket. 2. restarts randomly (i don't know why have seen the same behavior in galaxy grand as well) but occasionally.","This device is perhaps one of the BEST device SAMSUNG has ever created.Price is above 30k,but I think it's worth it.Camera is just AWESOME, quad core processor,5.55-inch Super AMOLED screen,with 2GB RAM,makes it the perfect device.SIMPLY AMAZING !!!!!!!!","Samsung has launched new note III you will get better specs than this note III vs this Full hd vs just hd 5.7in vs 5.5in 3gb vs 2gb 13 mp/2 mp vs 8 mp /1.8 mp new spen and software vs old laether back vs plastiic back and the most imporatnt thing is processor samsung said that note III will get snapdragon 800 or exynos 5420(this processor is faster than s4(5410) and will get mali 6core gpu instead of s4's powervr544mp4 which claimed 2x faster gpu than s4\"s) so think thrice before you buy this or you will be deeply disapointed this will ptrobably launched in india in month of october price will be around 36k to 42k inr so wait","Galaxy Note-II is really fabulous phone, with its 1.6 Ghz Quad Core processor, things are blaze fast... Internet over Wi-Fi reaches 12 mbps, which is not possible without an equally strong processor. Best part of the phone is the S-Pen feature, I have practically stopped carrying my paper diary since this phone purchased.. S-Pen has got lot of functionalities..

Excellent service by Flipkart again. Delivered just in 5 days. This phone is a beast. You have got more than enough RAM and memory to play any game and video. Clarity, touch, looks and every thing is just awesome. The upgrade offer was icing on the cake. Thanks to my friend Gaurav who discovered that my Nokia 5233 is available for exchange. I am enjoying every moment of it. Thank u flipkart again for making me proud owner of Note 2.","Having owned this device for quite some time now, I can confidently recommend this as an extremely capable and functional phablet. In the entire maze of options out there, this is one device which comes closest to being a complete package. I am no fan of Samsung, but must accept what is true..","Great product. Bought it under exchange offer. Fast delivery. I got my refund too and that also within 10 days. It easily fits in every pocket even if you are using a TPU case (which slightly increases the length and breadth of this already huge phone). This was my biggest concern. I don't need to carry it in my hands all the time. :) Stylus is fun to play with. And if you like to sketch its a killer. Games - Vice city and Six Guns (both are above 1 GB and very graphic intensive) are playing smooth, without any lags.","The phone is absolutely awesome. When I got the phone in my hand for the first rime, I was a bit concerned about the size of the set. But then I realised that the 5.5 inch screen is the best one to unveil the beauty of the handset. Thanks","Using it for the past 40 days. Previously had \"Galaxy Ace Duos\" which has 3.5 inches screen. So this is a huge leap ahead for me in terms of screen size. Was contemplating S3, S4 and Note2. Did not have a compelling reason to use any of the new features in S4. Also the Full HD screen seems to have 441 PPI which is not recognizable much by us. And then I got the 10,000 Rs exchange offer for Note 2 which meant paying 27,500 for Note 2 or S3. :-) Which meant I finally buy Note 2. *) It is really awesome to watch HD videos *) Reading books is also cool *) Chrome makes browsing almost the same as in Laptop *) Reading mails with pictures is also cool. *) Did not use the stylus much yet *) Maps is really cool *) Android 4.1.2 rocks *) Video calls are with high resolution. *) Battery comes to somewhere between 24 to 36 hours *) For normal phone calls it may look very big, but not very bad. All in all a very good substitute for laptop in the absence of it.","Hey Friends I got my Note 2 after thorough research for 3 months on which mobile to buy. What a beast he is and my experience is awesome. Battery Backup is great, Amazing camera, nice Audio output. Crystal clear sound. Weight is not all that heavy.

He is gonna by my close friend from now on. Only CON is : Such a costly mobile and samsung doesn't provide a flip cover in box.. Lil disappointed. But i purchased one separetly in flipkart itself. Bye have a nice day.","Waited eagerly to get this phone,Got the exchange offer. Not a lot to say about this beauty. One word describes it all \"Powerhouse\". I had an option to get this phone in a cheaper price from other online stores but the trust I have on Flipkart makes me Stay Loyal.Guys get this phone anyday better unlike S4 which keeps heating up in 5 mins.This is a one time investment trust me, phones line Canvas 4 are priced around 20,000.Anyone who thinks about class +VFM will go for this one Flipkart delivered the product in less than 30 hours which is awesome. Thanks","Flipkart delivery as usual awesome service. Got it in 30 hours. It was a good deal in one perspective. But you can buy it for 28k from shopclues though. I didn't knew this when I booked it. Anyways it's worth buying this product. Gave an old handset (Galaxy fit) which was used properly.","1. Flipkart is offering flat 10000 off against old phone exchange for which normal shopkeepers offer some 3000 to 8000 off depending upon type and condition of old phone. At flipkart its flat 10K off without asking any questions and any fuss. 2. Now, phone is available at 32500 so effective discount as of now is 5000 and not 10000 3. Regarding phone, even though its a little difficult to handle while using it for basic phone function. However, as a smartphone, its the best in terms of web access, mails, multitasking, handwritten notes, camera, display and everything. Its difficult to do smartphone functions on smaller size phones after using Note2.","One of the best offer one can get in flipkart. I got a very good deal.Exchanged my old phone for 10k and also 5% cash back on credit card. So totally I paid just 26k for the Note 2. And about Note 2, its an awesome phone. The Picture quality, video, music is very good. Overall, a amazing experience to own a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.","Loved the way you can attach a picture with your respective notes. The big screen make things easier to read and give the user a great experience with games as well. It is a user friendly phone.After using Nokia N8 for almost 3 years, i switched to Samsung galaxy note 2 and yesssssss, i can feel the difference every moment.My roommate owns a Samsung galaxy S4 but i don't even feel like having that phone no matter how many more features it may acquire. PHONE: Used mainly as a speaker phone with note taking capabilities or multi-tasking of any other kind including the ability to view and join contacts to the current call or text a quick message based on your current call. Bluetooth enabled for privacy and hands-free with exceptional range and voice-command options. Large dialer perfect for driving or the visually impaired. TABLET: With the Quad-Core and 2GB of RAM; enhanced video playback, gaming and photo editing is smooth and full featured. The ease-of-use for web browsing and navigation is increased with the enhanced S Pen which also acts like a mouse. The keyboard is large and easy to navigate with a number of input options already pre-loaded including improved handwriting recognition.","Could there be a better phone? Yes. At this price? NO! With such a superb processing speed and features, I am in love with this. Definitely a best buy. Note II deserves 6 out of 5 stars. I had S4, HTC one and Xperia Z as other options but when I saw the exchange offer, I just went for it. For a difference of 11-14k Rs and minor differences in processor and just one but a huge difference of camera, note 2 takes an edge over others. PS: Flipkart delivery: AWESOME.","Although I was a little skeptical about the whole process of exchanging old phone for new phone but flipkart carried it out smoothly. Timely delivered in best condition. Product working pretty well................................","The product is simply amazing.... really loved the using of the product, the pen response in the Note makes the product keep using often, Samsung gives best product with best of customer needs and worth using samsung products","This Product is freaking awesome. Battery back up is fab! And trust me, operations are carried away in a very convenient way and faster than any android. The S Voice service too is fab! Big Screen to show off! And the clarity of the display is Super! Has Jelly Bean 4.1.2. Specially the grey colour looks classy! Drawing sketches, adding notes are par excellence. You won't regret purchasing this one! ;) :) Completely Satisfied with my choice. :)","Very much satisfied with shopping from Flipcart. packaging was decent. They delivered it to me ontime. The person who delivered the product called me before reaching the site and was very helpful. Phone is very nice. Looks, performance, durability wise the product is awesome. Looking at the price of this product, Samsung or Flipcart should have provided a phone case and screencard.","I have been a fan of samsung phones since days when C 100 was as popular as the Note lineup. I always knew they had something in their display that sets them apart and now the world acknowledges it. I have rode the Note path before and the experience of using Note 1 was something rather revolutionary and that compelled me to go for Note 2. Note 2 unlike the predecessor is not in unchartered waters and enjoys the premium of a successor to the device for which the term Phablet was coined and lives upto it. The 2nd edition Phablet is by no means restricted and uses the full prowess of the quad core processor and the 2 gigs of team. Many out there might also be not aware that it has a dedicated quad core graphics processor (MALI 400 MP) as well and it makes splendid use of it. I felt the need to write this review at this point because recently I noticed people getting confused between mega 6.3 and note 2 and I would like to assert that preferring note 2 over mega 6.3 should be a no brainer. Mega is no where close to what note 2 offers. The SAMOLED HD display itself should seal the deal.I have been using it for over seven months now and believe me I have never seen it hesitate. Throw at it whatever you can think of and it handles it better than what one would expect. At a point out of curiosity I ran 80 apps in parallel and it never bothered for a hick up and isn't that the true purpose of smartphone. For Media consumption you always have that big Plasma TV or should you prefer the Mega. The s pen on note 2 keeps getting better with every firmware update and now it literally recognises the ugliest of my scribblings. The JB 4.2.2 is on its way and then it can definitely be matched to S4 in terms of all the eye candy it offers. One more thing you would have noticed that the titanium grey color option is limited to note2 and that makes it look exclusive. It gives the Phablet a clinch of its own and a sophisticated look. I am sure to use this device atleast till Note 3/4 pushes some revolutionary boundaries.Review written from S pen itself","Galaxy Note 2 is an excellent product from Samsung. It has a quad-core processor with 2 GB RAM and a great looking 5.5 inch screen. It is super responsive for all applications as well. I would rate it better than S3, etc. Got it at a great price. Moreover, it was delivered to me within 2 days of ordering. Excellent service from Flipkart.","Purchased Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100 last week and the product was delivered within the mentioned timeline. Good show by Flipkart as the product was delivered intact. Had done research on the handset and had zeroed in on this product couple of months back. I was very happy to see the offer and had exchanged a 2.5 years old Samsung galaxy duos mobile for this mobile (thoroughly used). Had just returned it along with the charger and they had not insisted for original packing like some other sites had. Very happy with the product, delivery and the offer..","Bought this Beauty 20 days ago from only 1 Spice outlet which obliged 2 exchange my nokia 5800 n think I was t only guy to get it in exchange for 5800 don't know n understand t crazy strategies of either Samsung or other retailers dat why can't 5800 b exchange when nokia 5233 which is half t price is eligible for exchange ?????? My 1st choice was HTC 1 but thank Samsung for that 10ooo off with 6 m months emi @ 0% int. Now for t pro's n con's. Pro's 1) 2 gb ram is an asset guys believe me. 2) I have never seen or heard of a toll free customer care so hats off 2 SAMSUNG for giving me a toll free customer care. 3) My set came pre loaded with 4.1.2 jellybean so don't know t pros n cons of 4.1.1 4) My phone works like a dream n smooth as butter but chrome has to go a long way in organising short cuts n desk top book marks as Opera mini is far better in organising. 5) Sound in t external speaker is very good because of t size although I could see only 1 big speaker n was wondering how that could give stereo effect in t options ? ??? 6)Inter face is quiet good. 7) Camera is superb although I'm not a photo buff as I had a get together on t 2nd day of buying this phone n t burst mode option with 20 shots in 10 seconds is excellent. 8) watching movies n video mode is good as I felt that it matched my 5800 in sound n video clarity was more in this by leaps n bounds. 9) Last but not least guys battery back up is amazing as I initially bought an extra charger for my shop also n have hardly used it as t back up was decent in any mode of my operation like gaming-browsing-video-photos or video mode. 10) S pen is a bonus guys. believe me although I've not explored it still my office going Nephew loved it although he uses iphone. As for t con's 1) 4 STARS FOR T SIZING AS I'M A SMALL MAN N M HANDS ACHE WHILE USING T MOBILE.HOPE IT STOPS ACHING AFTER A FEW DAYS ? 2) MY PHONE MEMORY SHOWS ONLY 10 GB IN TOTAL N NOT 16 GB AS IN T RECORDS ????? 3) Pls remember to update Os t moment u buy t mobile as my set hung on day 2 WITH 1GB RAM FREE N VERY SIMPLE GAMES N BASIC APPS. but Samsung cust care was very kind to solve t prob online only although I hated magadi road service centre's visit in bangalore for its fish market scenario n most horrible service n a looooong Que. 4) Have given 4 Stars only for t Size Am unhappy n SILENT PROTESTING Samsung'S DECISION TO LAUNCH 1GB RAM IN INDIAN S3 ALTHOUGH SOUND WOULD'VE BEEN LESS WHEN COMPARED TO NOTE 2 5) LASTLY GUYS BE CAREFUL WHEN USING LIMITED DATA PACKS N KEEP T MOBILE DATA MODE IN OFF MODE IF U R NOT USING T NET ALL DAY AS I HAVE EXHAUSTED MY 2GB 3G DATA IN JUST 12 DAYS AS MOST 50 TO 60 PERCENT HAS GONE FOR UPDATES N WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO STOP SOME APPS UPDATES N SUFFER LATER ????? 6) TRY PUTTING SOME RUBBER EDGED COVER FOR PROTECTING T CORNERS N PHONE FROM SHOCKS N DROPS INSTEAD OF THE REGULAR FLIP COVER AS T GLASS IS A GORILLA GLASS U NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT SCRATCHES. 7) LAST BUT NOT LEAST I PRAY TO GOD N ALL T COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN UNIFORM PRICING STRATEGY'S N NOT GATE CRASHING IN REDUCTION OF PRICES ????","Got this phone from Flipkart 2 days ago. Was very impressed by the design,screen size is massive,Multimedia is awesome,camera quality is breathtaking. Overall it is a beast on its part. Would recommend buying with the exchange offer !!","Hey I bought this Note 2 last week and after a week of a use, believe me it is the only phone that has satisfied me so far now. As an Android developer you know how much you expect from the phone and this was the only phone that has fulfilled and exceeded all my expectations. Only one thing which I was not happy with was screen color. Don't know which AMOLED Panel they use and which combination of RGB color they use that screen doesn't look that much bright. I have an IPad3 and when i compare it with my Note2, it appears very dim. Else everything is super sexy. Looking for best performance and style and entertainment, go for this phone XX","I purchased Note 2 last year, and mind you I am still awestruck with the phone and its features The phone inspite of being a Phablet is very sleek and one of the thinnest phones around. It comes with a stylus which is unique with air view feature. The clarity is truly mesmerising and vivid. In terms of performance it is very fast and also very userfriendly thanks to the Touchwiz You can play all kinds of videos, movies , HD as well with ease With the current price of Rs. 27000 at flipkart i guess its a best opportunity to go for this phone Pros: Best Battery, lasts more than 1 day in heavy usage Very proactive touchscreen Bright colours Stylus is icing on the cake Very thin and easy to hold More ergonomic than Note 1 Cons: Build is little plastiky","Excellent delivery process.It has been a delightful experience to purchase from Flipkart. An excellent product from Samsung- though it seems an expensive gizmo at first view. My baggages to workplace had included my netbook in the past, with cables, a wireless modem, usb devices,etc. And it seemed a burden to carry two bags. My target was to purchase a device which could eliminate the need for a Netbook. A tablet seemed a worthy device- but my experience with HCL Me left a hole in my pocket and a terrible experience of a cumbersome device, heavy on the wrists. 1. Not meant for a phone. 2. Excellent phablet for browsing,mail, eliminates use for keyboard for typing","Excellent value for money - if you are comfortable with the larger than normal screen. At Rs.25,875/- think it's really a good buy. Color saturation is something not so natural, compared to S2 and also missing the Memo on Galaxy S2 and importing that content into Note 2, But otherwise, having a good time - as to me it's more a data access device than a phone and it fits that use pretty well.","Useful Interesting Features of Galaxy Note 2, rather than the common features First to mention, before buying this Beast: Galaxy Note 2, i had read a lot of reviews here in Flipkart on this mobile, but Max of them were on the common features that almost everyone knows from like the: -5.5 screen -Quad-Core -2GB RAM -Super AMOLED capacitive Touchscreen -16GB Internal -64GB External Expandable -Camera: 8MP(Main), 1.9(Front) -NFC -OS: Android Jelly Bean -GPU: Mail-400MP -Stylus Pen Yes, i agree, these are the Excellent Features which other phones cannot compete easily, BUT, there are loads of other interesting stuffs that any TECH SAVY person will like a lot!!! After buying this Galaxy Note 2 last week, i had been trying to figure out the extra features that this beast offers in excess to the mentioned above ones. Some of them are as follows: -First of all, the most attractive feature that i really liked was the Motion Sensor Capabilities that this beast is offering. Let me note down some of them as tested by me: 1) To unlock the device with motion, tap and hold a point on the screen, and then tilt the device forwards. 2) When you pick up the device after it has been idle for some time or when the screen has turned off, it vibrates if you have missed calls or new messages. 3) While viewing a call, a message, or contact details on the phone screen, simply pick up and hold the device to your ear to make a call to that number. 4) Tap and hold an item on the screen, and then move the device to the left or right to move the item to another panel on the Home screen or the Applications screen in that direction. 5) When an image is zoomed in, tap and hold a point on the screen, and then move the device in any direction to browse the image. 6) While you are cheking mails or contacts in a page and you reach the middle or the last of the list, simply Double-tap the device to move to the top of a list of contacts or emails. 7) While the screen is locked, tap and hold the screen, and then rotate the device to landscape orientation to launch the camera. 8) Turn over the device(making it lie down with back-side up) to mute ringtone, pause media playback, or mute the FM radio. 9) Shake the device to search for Bluetooth devices. 10) Shake the device to update the list of emails or information from Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance etc. 11) Sweep your hand sideways across the screen from right to left to capture a screenshot. 12) Cover the screen with a palm to pause media playback. Move it away from the screen to resume. 13) Tap and hold two points on the screen, and then tilt the device back and forth to zoom in or out. 14) When the touch screen is turned off, move your hand across the Proximity/Light sensor to turn on the screen lightly and view the number of missed calls and new messages, the battery power level, and more. The above are the special features that this phone provides in respect to various motions. - Secondly, like the Galaxy S3, it has the Smart Stay, which enables the phone to keep the screen on as long as you are looking at it. When you close your eyes or move away from looking into the screen, the Phone screen will automatically turn off. - Thirdly, with the Quad-core processor and 2GB RAM, Gamers will really love this phone since some VERY HIGH RESOLUTION GAMES are just running with not a single point of lag in this phone. - Fourthly, You would luv to watch videos in this phone due to itz big screen and the very good quality videos running smoothly. - Fifthly, Music quality is really very good and descent. Radio works perfect. - Sixthly, SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) Level is relatively low(The lower the Better) for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 in comparision to other phones: Galaxy Note 2: 0.171 W/kg Galaxy Note: 0.39 W/kg Galaxy S3: 0.342 W/kg Galaxy S2: 0.338 W/kg iPhone 4S: 0.98 W/kg iPhone 5: 0.951 W/kg HTC One X: 0.909 W/kg Apart from the above mentioned features: - I have not tested with the camera yet since i already have a Digital Camera. But as read from reviews, the camera is quite good in its capabilities, with 1.9 front camera is just great. - Also not tested with the full capability of the Stylus Pen, since it has loads of functionalities that has to be checked in details :-) So simply after examining withlots of such exciting features, it simply stands out tall in the market.","FantaBulousTastic..... That's how you can describe this phone and delivery of flipkart. I had this phone already, but bought it for one of my relative. Since I have been using this phone for quiet some time, you can only keep falling in love with this phone ( only if you are ready to use both hands to operate this beast). Feature wise this is no doubt the best available... pricy ..Yes A word of caution though.... Since it is quiet wide, you will actually need your full palm to grab it and then operate it using the other hand. But there is a feature for One-Hand operation as well.... and as usual flipkart's delivery is just too good.... 15 hours from order to delivery (Though keep in mind that I live in Delhi) If you are considering buying it, go ahead and buy... no second thoughts :)","Functionwise, this phone leaves no desires. It offers all important and unimportant features. The display is good. The only drawback is its size. This is more tablet than a phone. It is not very handy.","Using this device from past 1 month. This was my first Android phone and with all its specification provided by Samsung i am in cloud 9 right now. Flawless UI and processor speed. and lots of new feature like Air View. still i am unable to uncover all its feature. Its Beast in Smartphone market. Though size is 5.5inches it will create some difficulties in handling but i insist you to buy Samsung's original Flip cover. make sure the cover is NFC supported only then it is genuine. it will cost you 1350 Rs.","hey people, i m in need of some guidance!! it would b helpful if anyone could clear my doubt... i bought this device today.. it say there is 16 gb memory, but when i opened the device and started using it, the actual memory available was only 10.36 gb, can anyone tell me why is there such a difference??","I bought my galaxy note II around seven months back and still I'm luving it. Awesome phone to use and have fun with. I recommend this to anyone who is planning to buy phone above 30k range. Go for it.... :)","Guys....... I have seen many reviews below....... Max people are having 5 start.... after buying this i came to know that why many people are giving this much appraise to this product..... While i havent bought this from FK..... Really telling you that anyone can buy this with closed eyes... There is no problem with this phone..... Go for it..... !!!!","I purchased NoteII 6 month before. Till now I am fully satisfy with my investment of nearly 40K. Obviously now a days this 0-0-0 skim came and price also much less. Gaming wise very good, watching wise- no compare to any thing. ya some what not handy, for this reason i already dropped my phone and invest again 8K for the screen, which U need to take care. Otherwise its excellent set boss.","Nicely Designed and crafted Product. Thanks to flipkart for prompt delivery. I Must say after owning a ipad for last 3-4 years this is the first gadget which has impressed me. I would recommend the product to all the tech savvy people who can afford the price.","Samsung Galaxy note 2 is Great product, great specifications, many reviews mentions better battery life when compared to any other similar mobile phone. better to grab, after all its from Samsung and with Flipkart Guaranteee.","The gadget is wonderful. I will not comment on pricing. I very well knew the same and I went for it and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Scores beyond comparison over competitor breeds from IPHONE , SONY, LG. Look and feel along with UI is very friendly. Even my 5 year old has got acclimatized to its operation with precision and that shows what product designing is all about. Cannot be only rated as KEWL for the happy go lucky youth but a wonderful token of gratitude even for the elderly. All will love it simply because of its ease of operation","Very prompt delivery by Flipkart. it was delivery to me within 2 working days as advertised on this website. This is the best Smart phone I have used till now. excellent features and stylish looks makes it a prized possesion. It's worth the money paid for.","The Samsung galaxy note 2 is a niche device. with its 5.5 inch super amoled screen it is one of the best screens available for a smartphone at the moment!and that too its non pentile. many people are considering buying sony's new flagship the xperia z , it has a full HD 1080p screen but its viewing angles are not that good,Faster web browsing & downloading, incredible 8 MP camera, pop up browser & video player is too great, large shiny screen makes people stare at my smartphone, most creativity stuff the S pen.Handwriting recognition.. for any input, I do not even take out S-Pen, just write word with my finger and it recognizes text so well Fabulous Galaxy Note 2 - The King of All!!!","Bought the beast last week, but not from flipkart, though i thot about writing a review. This phone is for the maximum entertainment and u wont find any lagging or slowness in doing the same. Also, this phone is worth for the price and tr to experience the feeling of a NOTE 2 owner ;)","I've been using this phone from feb 13 now and i can rightly tell you this is best phone Best phone I have ever used. It is very fast with its 1.6 GHz Quad Core Cortex-A9 Processor and 2gb ram. screen is absolute joy to look at with the vibrant colors. Its very good even for reading eBooks & browsing. The multiwindow really shows the phones capability.The biggest advantage of this is phone is its battery life. You can forget the charger for the weekend trip & still expect the charge to be present when you return. I even got 3 days with about 2 hr WiFi usage per day with 1-2 hour video per day and other tasks. Stylus is something unique to this phone and Samsung has succeeded to a great extent in it. My only complain is they could have have improved the built quality nevertheless it is still a solid phone. Also hoping they will add the screen recorder function as advertised. If you don't mind using a large phone(it is still pocketable). now i ordered my Second Samsung Galaxy Note 2 mobile phone from flipkart and also get 15% cash back with 12 months EMI option.","I'VE USED NOTE 2.N MY DAD LIKED IT SO I GIFTED HIM IDENTICAL MAGICON M NOTE [10 K].N I MUST SAY BOTH R AMAZING.BUT IF 1 NEED JUST TO SHOW OFF THEN DONT WASTE 36 K FOR NOTE 2! GO 4 IDENTICAL N CHEAPER N NON ADVERTISED PHONES.SAMSUNG IS GETTING MILLIONS BY THIS 1 BUT ITS NOT WORTH 36K MAN!WE CAN BUY A LAPTOP IN THIS PRICE!!!","the note 2 has everything except for dual sim (not really needed for me). the s-pen feature is unique only to this one and the older note. trust me the performance of this beast is so good that any application will easily run and the refinement and UI are so nice that any other phone you use will feel sub par. do not listen to people who complain about the huge size, u will definitely get used to it in a couple of days and it easily fits into your jeans or front shirt pocket. when you buy the note 2 you buy a supreme quality product which will serve you for years to come and the advanced hardware will not disappoint you even after 2-3 years. I feel very happy having bought it and would recommend it to anyone who can afford it (do not buy if your budget is less than 15k) but if you do be prepared to receive amazed and jealous glances from anyone who looks at it. it beats every other phone, not only in looks but in performance and features as well. It is definitely recommended for people who want to do everything they can with their smartphones and trust the battery to last at least a day (with heavy usage) and 2 days (moderate usage) or 3 days even!!( with light usage). the number of features and cool stuff that is packed into it are too many to list here, but rest assured that apart from dual sim, there is nothing this powerful phablet cannot do. only cons according to me- 1. the phone needs proper cover (protection to prevent any damage if it falls/bumps) 2. the premium-ness of this phone will suck you in and other phones will pale in comparison. :)","Such An Awesome Phone And Value For Money.. Very Stylish.. Only Draw Back Is That If You Drop It/ Screen Is Broken(Which Is Not That Easy Bcoz Of Super AMOLED Capacitive Screen) This Phone Is Veryyy Awesome.. App Run So Smoothly.. It Hardly Hangs.. Jelly Beans Is Awesome.. Screen Size Fits For Me..!! BEST PHONE TILL NOW..!!","I'm using this beauty for 2 months now and it is a miracle! The stuff I can do with the Note 2 is unthinkable on other phones. Even at the top end, Note 2 is THE BEST phone and offers the BEST VALUE for money. Note 2 will reign until Galaxy S4 and Note 3 takes over the mantle of the best smartphone. Hats off to Samsung!","Really fast, display resolution is good, but the icing on the cake is the S-pen. Battery backup is also very good. better than any iphone in my opinion. Only Drawback is microsim which reduces the compatibility with other phones.","Greatest Phone ever used by me. Loaded with powerful quad core processor and 2gb ram and a very big screen,battery life is very good its performance is very smooth and as of now its a very good device worth buying.","today i got my new note II and i like yahooooooo ,cant express what amazing screen clearity , and game performance...does how think note II is just waste of money so ur missing sugar in the juice guys.","Received it within 2 days of order...

I will suggest everyone who wants everything in an Android device,please please go for Samsung Galaxy Note II. Also thanks Flipkart for delivering it on 2nd day of payment. Thanks again......","In the business feature list it is mentioned that there is a document editor. However there is no document editor comes with this phone. Need to buy one. Or at least I've not found one so far using the phone for 3 days.","Well, there are no words to describe this monster of a Phone. It's just EPIC!!! For starters, it just does EVERYTHING. You can't ask for more in a smartphone. Note taking, S-pen, Jelly Bean, Quad Core, Super Fast, Awesome Camera, Amazing Screen, Awesome Web Browsing and Gaming, Brilliant Battery Life, you just name it and this beast has it. So in short it's just \"NOTABULOUS\". Here are my pros and cons: ---> PROS: 1) Amazing Screen with 5.5\" and Super Amoled NON-PENTILE HD Display which just throws life in everything. 2) Quad Core CPU with Jelly Bean just gets the job done in seconds. 3) S-pen is the best thing which just takes the experience to the next level. 4) Amazing for watching movies and playing games. 5) Fast Web Browsing and makes reading an ease. 6) Good for Office as well as personal use. 7) Absolute Mammoth Battery Life. ---> CONS: 1) Well, it's not suitable for Small Hands and for those who don't like Big Screen Phones. 2) As PPI is only 267, it's not super sharp as the S3 but still clear enough. 3) Sometimes it lags but it only happens on some rare occasions. 4) As it's Super Amoled, so the Whites are a little Warm, Hence the colors look a little over-saturated and won't give it a natural look. Some like it while some don't like it but overall it looks Amazing. So those who have some money to cash in then they can definitely opt for the Note 2. But if you can wait for a month or two, then you'll be in treat for the Samsung Galaxy S4 which is the next Best Thing. But for now the Note 2 is the Best option. So just 3 Words for this super-phone: \"NOTE2 IS GOD\".","its a very very nice device...all options are amazing.......really i proud to by a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100,Ram speed is well.....processor also good..............internet browsing performance is nice.........","its a very very nice device...all options are amazing.......really i proud to by a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100,Ram speed is well.....processor also good..............internet browsing performance is nice.........","Apart from some excellent tech specs, here are some great & unique features of this phablet: S PEN: It has got the most advanced stylus which becomes handy in viewing videos & checking mails (AIRVIEW) and also editing images. PAPER ARTST: It is my favourite photo editing app and is not available on android market. Apart from galaxy note 2, only new galaxy camera has this feature. ALLSHARE PLAY (dlna): With just a press of a button, i can run the media from my phone on any other smart device requiring only a wifi connection. Texting becomes very easy & fast with its advanced clipboard memory which automatically recommends frequently used words in sequence.","Got this mobile locally ,,,very good mobile and its big too ...everything is nice and no cons yet,,,u should go for it as its the best one till now !!!! the specs are nice and the perfomance too .. GO FOR IT !!!!!!!","i newly bought dis fone/tab its amazing i will not tell any of the feature as its not easy...many featues ....it has left apple behind ...even i phone 5...its also beter than s3 as in my view...the only CONS i found in it is that we have 2 empty our pocket for this but i think it is all worth...if you have option to buy it ...dont think just go ahead and buy this spectacular mobile/tab","This is a great phone to have, with very high end specifications, but the only trouble with this phone is its size, I am quite sure people with big hands would love to have it, but the screen size is the same size as my hands, even with a stylus it will look like a tablet in my hands that I'd rather not like people staring at me carrying it. But those who love this phone should buy it, it comes with a stylus too. I am a Xperia fan, but I have to say well done samsung with such tech.","well the phone is pretty amazing but the probs is that 38 k sounds like a hefty amount.Spendin 38k for a mobile like device nowadays does nt sound like a nice deal...anyways the device has better performance in terms of ram,processor etc plus it provides a lot of xtra utilities when compared to the s3.but the problem is that samsung keeps on updating their products on a regular basis you become confused all of a sudden..Now if ur thinkin of buying this device i would say WAIT....WAIT for the S4 cause technology gets better n better day by day.the s4 gets released at the end of feb. @ the MWC.but if ur dying for a cutting edge techy gadget then the doors are open to u..i would say GO ON>>>>>>","Speechless!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing phone or should rather say it's an amazing journey to the next level of technology............. Samsung becoming god of youth gadget freaks..................................................","I bought this phone for 35.5k.What kills this phone is lack of s pen related apps.battery backup is nice.I would say that if u really love gadgets go for it.If you dont prefer a tile in your hand,dont go for it","I got this phone delivered in two days after placing the order. Happy to see the neat packaging. I may not be satisfied to this level, even if I go and buy in SAMSUNG store for this price. Such a perfect company sealed box and new stock!! Great to shop with you... keep up the same In Combo deal, the cover which I got from Samsung (EFC-1J9FWEGINU) for 1K is not worth\u2026the looks and quality of cover is just average. The size of phone is bit huge and quite uncomfortable to hold/carry every time \u2026 Apart from that performance is good, runs anything and everything. Screen display (Super AMOLED) is also too good and it\u2019s a pleasure to watch HD videos and movies. Just note that it needs Micro SIM","First of i would like to thank Samsung for their amazing product. Pros - 1. Amazing processor Speed 2. Can play almost all types of videos 3. Never hangs (Using it for a month) Cons - Sometimes difficult to put in Jeans pocket while driving 2 wheeler I thought of buying this product through Flipkart. But, i got the better price in Pai Interational for 36,200. So i did not bought it through Flipkart.","For people who are staying away due to the humungous size, yes it is huge and it does look and feel awkward initially. But within two hours of usage you will totally get used to it. You will find other screens very inadequate after this. I was confused big time between S3 and Note 2, but I decided to go for note 2. Its quite an experience to work on such a huge phone. Go for it, you wont regret it.","First of all Kudos to Flipkart, for their superb fast service. I booked the combo pack on 6 of dec & wholaaa it was delivered on the next day itself. Great! The combo pack is nice very nice & speaking about the Note 2, even the dictionary will run out of words. Buy it, enjoy it , love it.","Yeah i am right, After note to there is no other super power..... Pros:- Processor is as powerful as Zeus's lighting bolt(or more then that) R.A.M is more then enough that it can even consume the Hercules Every thing is Pro is this phone As far as concerned About cons... In this phone's dictionary There is no space for Con word","i used this phone it sounds to me that....this is more batter to its price n battery is also batter n its going to 3 to 4 days to using call n sms n games playing......overall i liked this phone......N its android verson is letest n its verson is not having in any phone n its touch is lot of batter n size is also good n i mverry happy to buy this phone.","Excellent phone. Real long battery life. Battery comes down from 100% to 30% after a full day's use of 3G, Wi-fi, music/video and calling. Might be a little big for people with average sized hands. Only negative point is that there is no OTG cable in the box.","I bought this phablet last sunday, from a Samsung Store as I was much excited to grab one at the earliest. Hardly a week and all I can say is that NOTE 2 is the real BEAST. Ahead of S3. Those who are confused and comparing between Iphone 5 and Samsung, I would advise to go ahead with this phone because, NOTE 2 has much much more new features than Iphone5. Iphone is just a waste of money as I have used my friends IPhone5. Pros : 1) 5.55\" Display makes watching HD videos fun also playing 3D games. 2) 2GB RAM. Better than 1GB RAM of much expensive Iphone5. 3) 1.6 GHz Quad Core Processor, which runs butter smooth. 4) S-Pen for editing images on the go. 5) Latest 4.1.1 JellyBean Android O.S. Cons : 1) Plastic Body.(Well that is not a big issue ;) ) 2) Can't use on a single hand esp in the night when you send messages ;). Overall the best phone of the 2012. Guys just grab it. No 2nd thought!!!","I HAVE NOT BOUGHT THE NOTE 2 BUT HAVE USED IT.I HAVE ALSO USED S3 AS WELL.BOTH THESE ARE WONDERFUL PHONES WITH LARGE CRISP DISPLAYS AND SUPERFAST QUADCORE PROCESSORS.BUT I WOULD ADVICE EVERYONE NOT TO CONSIDER I PHONE 5 AS CRAP.APPLE IS FOLLOWING A PATH OF PORTABILITY AND USABILITY WHILE SAMSUNG PHONES JUST KEEP BECOMING BIGGER AND BULKIER.I PHONE 5 IS TRADEMARK PRODUCT OF APPLE.EVEN WITH A DUAL CORE PROCESSOR IT MANAGES TO BE FASTER THAN THE S3 WHEN IT COMES TO BROWSING AND APPS AND NO VOICE RECOGNITION IS AS GOOD AS SIRI SO FRIENDS,NOTE2 AND S3 ARE WONDERFUL BUT TO ME I PHONE 5 IS THE BEST","Currently I am using Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 for the last 14 months. My friend bought this and its really a Gajab phone. I am already using its part 1 so no matter of size for me. I am Planning to buy this new Beast very soon. Flipkart delivery every body knows, it's fast and secure in mobiles section, but slow in laptop sections. Anyway... Life is very short, Enjoy the fullest. .....","I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note II two days back and it's working like 3G. Phone speed is like fire, so many features...which i cannot unable to expresss...I am very much satisfied and thanks to Samsung such a wonderful phone discovered. I am completely forget my laptop and this is more than enough. No need LAPTOP. I connected with Airtel 3G. Phone access + 3G Speed - Great Phone with high speed internet. Excited more, still exciting......Really the Galaxy Note II is VALUE FOR MONEY. I purchased the phone after seen all the below reviews and it was a perfect. No words to say further. Only one i want to be pointed out that some of reviews says phone is too big. Its not really too big which i felt after purchased and you can manage and handle the phone easily. I Love this phone and completely satisfied. GREAT PHONE.","Gud phone to use. Long batery life upto 18 hrs. Having some android bugs. 1.I have been using it since past 20 days, It got automatically restarted 2 times. 2. Automatic calling feature bug: if you put your phone to your years this may call any other number as well instead of calling the person from whom you are reading message.","been using this product for a while an overall nice product even though i didnt get it from flipkart. Gets most of my jobs done but the onl problem i face is takes up a lot of space in my jeans pocket literally leaving no place for anything els oon the same pocket and also i must mention the amazing battery life of the superphone/phablet it lasts more than a day on exxtensive use i am very happy with it","Open any number of applications it does not slows down....battery runs smoothly for more than 2 days with moderate usage. Huge processor, huge RAM, applications open as smooth as slicing butter, big screen makes playing games and reading a sheer pleasure, S pen and S note are remarkable, camera is pretty decent at 8 megapixel( people wanting more should buy SLRs), air view is another innovation, it is miles ahead of any contemporary mobile....using it for more than a month now absolutely no lags experienced..... Some people may complain its a bit too big.... but that is the exact reason why i bought it...as a phone it stands out from all the other phones. absolutely no problems","Truly a wonderful experience buying this device. Pros : Good build quality. Beautiful display. Blazing fast. S-Pen proves to be very useful. Best hand held media consumption device. Value for money. cons : Very huge not meant for men with small fingers","Wow. Its been little more than a week using this phablet and the experience is awesome. The only reason I waited for buying this phone was because of its huge size, understanding that it may not fit into the pocket but believe me once you bought this phone and started working on it, you will think that size should have not been below this. It's perfectly fits into jeans pocket but person who use to keep phone in shirt pocket have to change their habbit. S-pen is awesome and it help me sending online Diwali greeting with my handwritten wishes. I would love to bought this phone from flipkart but I got with flip cover in the same rate from elsewhere (Diwali scheme). I really respect flipkart service. Feature wise this phone beats everyone currently present in the market and certainly will compete the upcoming one. So in all those who are planning to buy a good phone having enough money in their pocket, don't hesitate in buying this beast as its a value for money. For a month I read many reviews and finally bought one.","I ordered this product with an understanding that it might take 6-8 days BUT got this in 3 days - Price is competetive with show room price - Both Phone and Bluetooth is awesome - I ordered this product with an understanding that it might take 6-8 days BUT got this in 3 days - Price is competetive with show room price - Both Phone and Bluetooth is awesome -","PROS = 2GB RAM to face any platform. No competition for 1.6 GHz quad core processor. Ultimate surfing experience . Really bright super AMOLED CONS = Yet to be developed for JELLY BEANS (4.1)","No doubt this is the best smart phone made till date, but get it only if you have enough free time to explore and use all its features. If your requirement is just to make/receive calls/SMSs and/or to play games like temple run, then definitely this phone is a no no. You can instead buy a mid range android phone. If you are a game or a movie freak then this the best you can get because of its great display and great battery life.","Thanks to Flipkarts awesome servcice. This phone is huge and even easy to hold. I am 16 and i dont really feel any difficulty while holding this phone. This phone fits perfect in my hand (middle-finger to those who say it doesnt!) This phone sports 4.1.1 JellyBean OS which has a great interface, plus 2GB RAM and 1.6GHz Quad Core Exynos processor makes it one of the fastest Phones (Phablet) in the current market. 8MP Camera, S-Pen and other features makes this phone delightful. My over-all experience was awesome! I am new to android and i must say Android>iOS!! Good Going Samsung! :)","One bug in Samsung Galaxy Note II - It keeps on beeping continuously during a call as though there is another incoming call :( .. the worst part is it continues to beep even after the call.... this is so annoying... the only way to get out of this annoying sound is to restart the phone... :( Except this one problem... the phone is ultimate phone...","If you are connected to any creative field like fashion ,art , graphic design or if prefer using a pen there couldn't be a better option . I am a petite person with tiny hands and i DON'T find it too big ...its perfect to hold ,looks elegant and does what it says and much more . For me this is the best phone in the world .","I preferred over HTC One X - we can attach Micro-SD , Battery can be replaced. I preferred over Galaxy S III - S Pen, real estate , @ GB RAM and Quad Core. Using phone is a breeze to use. Wish to bought from Flip-kart but they do not sell insurance and extended warranty.","I had bought this phablet a couple of days ago and i must tell u that it is just fabulous.Previously i had the galaxy note n7000 and i used it for about 8 months but this one is far better than the previous..its as smooth as silk.display is far better although its ppi is lower than note n7000 (267 ppi vs 285 ppi).movie watching is a treat. Gameplay is awesome.everythin is good.it truly makes u feel on top of the world with the most expensive android gadget in today's times!!!!","I don't need to mention about specs, its clearly available above...what i really want to share is my experience with S pen, and it was out of the world..I have used so many stylus before but they were more of liability then an asset, in common language, they were pain in the Ass..lol But my experience with this was unbelievable. This is surely the gadget of the year 2012..","Its an excellent phone with very good features overall. Currently best in market. If you use stylus and don't mind the size of the phone, its a definite buy.. BUT.. Galaxy S3 has almost all features sans stylus/pen and size is suitable for all users, so recommended over note 2. Personally I had some issues using the S-Pen and sometimes it will do things i din't want it to. But I guess I just need some tine to get used to it.","Using this awesome phbalet from past 3 days..! its just so good... those who r worrying about the size let me tell u... the big screen will just waaoow u.... its so good do daily stuff on the big screen... qwerty typing goes so well on this... on both orientations... there no lag of any sort as the hardware is so good.. screen is so crisp, s-pen works as a charm. Jelly bean is yummm...! n samsung gives the update for multi window muti-task i.e u can do 2 windows at a time like split screen as in NOte 10.1... I am Loving this Phablet... n m preety sure the one who buys is will not regret it in any sort... i must say Bigger the Better...! size is also a plus.. Samsung has done a very good job for the design, they have made full use of the size and don't worry guys its easily pocket-able.. I preferred Titanium grey color... it looks so classy than White..! Go for it guys..","I recently got this Phone + Tablet, quiet amazing in performance, definitely useful for someone who is on the business side. S- Note is much more advance than Note 1, Tech specs are best in the current market. From the looks you might feel that it is elder brother of popular mobile S3 from Samsung. But when you use it, you will know its much better that S3. Comparing with Galaxy Note 1, the size of this one same though the screed slightly larger than it. Much better in everything else. You will love it even more if you love Galaxy Note 1. Overall a must buy for someone who wants find something which can be phone as well as tablet.","With a wonderfully vivid 5.5-inch Super AMOLED HD screen and meaty innards, there's no doubt that the Note 2 is the top dog when it comes to raw grunt and function. 2GB RAM.... Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9... Are you kidding me..!!! Add to that the S Pen functionality, which has been given a bunch of new fancy tricks.. would love to buy one..","pretty good but galaxy note is far far far better than note 2 it's useless to waste 10000 for note 2,coz it don't give as much facilities in comparison with samsung galaxy note :(////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","Device have the features to make you \"wow\".Bigger screen.latest android OS and other features.you can replace it with your tablet but you can't fit it in your pocket as your cell phone. A device for better visuals and performance but not handy. Samsung Galaxy Note II"]}

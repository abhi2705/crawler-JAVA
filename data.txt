-----------------------Reviews --------<span class="review-text"> Eagerly Waiting! Looking to buy a new phone....Which is better: Nokia Lumia 925 OR The 5. Battery remains the concern in both the phones but camera good in case of Lumia. let's wait </span>
<span class="review-text"> Been using this mobile from last week,no words to say,amazing phone, only con about this device is the camera,its not that great </span>
<span class="review-text"> I received this phone yesterday from Google play store. <br /> I noticed two issues as of now- <br /> 1. The charger makes a buzzing sound which is very annoying. Then I plugged the USB cable with my IPad mini charger and no sound. So, the charger that comes with N5 has issue. <br /> 2. Vibration motor makes a annoying sound too. For example when you press keys.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </span>
<span class="review-text"> one of the best phones in the market.<br /> At this price range it is the best phone with all the android updates first to this phone.<br /> if u r an android fan and love customization .GO for it.<br /> I have no regret purchasing this phone.<br /> The best machine till date from GOOGLE.<br /> If your budget is 30000 go for it.<br /> Fits perfectly in all aspects-&gt;PERFORMANCE,GAMING,CAMERA,SCREEN SIZE,DISPLAY and after all its a nexus device ..GO FOR IT. </span>
<span class="review-text"> one of the best phones in the market.<br /> At this price range it is the best phone with all the android updates first to this phone.<br /> if u r an android fan and love customization .GO for it.<br /> I have no regret purchasing this phone.<br /> The best machine till date from GOOGLE.<br /> If your budget is 30000 go for it.<br /> Fits perfectly in all aspects-&gt;PERFORMANCE,GAMING,CAMERA,SCREEN SIZE,DISPLAY and after all its a nexus device ..GO FOR IT. </span>
<span class="review-text"> Hi all i poses this phone from 25th Nov'13, 3 days after the launch in India. i am writing this review after complete 3 months of use.<br /> 1) Got updates 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 within 1 week of use.. fixing all the bugs of kitkat.<br /> 2) Pure Android performance.<br /> 3) on 2g and normal cell battery survives 2 days(48 hours), 72 hours when with no internet and only normal calling.<br /> 4) Out of 2 gb ram 1gb ram is always in use... Google services keep using that.. so u have 1 gb for other purpose..after clearing ram from clean master(android app) the ram consumed is 47%.<br /> 5) As all phone slow down after usage.. as many apps are downloaded, compared to new phone, Nexus 5 will also. no lag in touch, only lag in start up of heavy apps like subway surfer and temple run.<br /> <br /> Till now no new phone has been launched after it to its competition. so Enjoy nexus experience. </span>
<span class="review-text"> Guys I am using this phone since 2 weeks and it is just awesome. Probably the best touch you will get on any android phone. It has the stock android 4.4 means you will be the first to get the latest updates. The stock android android works smoothly. Well the camera is little slow to capture your favorite shot but the update is going to fix that soon. Some people may find the speaker annoying but hey..its an teardown version of LG G2 which is probably the best smartphone in the market. If you are a heavy mobile user than the battery will last till the evening. Other than that its a perfect smartphone. <br /> I am lovin it ;) </span>
<span class="review-text"> Undoubtedly the best 'thing' that Rs. 29990 can buy. And powerful enough to beat Note 3, Xperia Z1, LG G2, and of course iPhone 5S. </span>
<span class="review-text"> i dont own this phone to be true but atleast reading its specs and watching videos on youtube i can say definitely the best branded phone with such specs i mean 2.3 ghz quaz core!!! +full hd display +2gb ram+adreno 330 gpu (nena mark=approx 58 which is very good for 1080p display gaming )nfc+wireless charging +4g +4.4 kitkat .yes i know micromax ,gionee ,etc rebranded companies have full hd and all around 20k but come on guys this is google/lg we are talking about here you simply cant compare between the quality of hardware these two offer !!! <br /> so if u are willing to spend 30k on a android mobile then close your guys and purchase this future smooth fast future proof phone </span>
<span class="review-text"> lovely phone iam using it since 3 days.. checked throughly..<br /> lovely phone.. a must buy if your range is 30K<br /> <br /> no issues at all. kitkat looks and feels kool.. tho hangout view of sms is kinda irritating.<br /> <br /> lovely battery and benchmark tests.<br /> <br /> go fr it </span>

-----------------------Reviews --------<span class="review-text"> actually waiting for 32gb version best ever in the world i hve a sample piece of this mob and it is too good <br /> <br /> but it is too sensitive it can break into pieces mainly the front screen <br /> so u need to buy a nice case for tht <br /> etc etc things are best<br /> <br /> and if competition for this is absoulutely xperia z1 can afford any one of them </span>
<span class="review-text"> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world </span>
<span class="review-text"> 2 stars for obtaining the phone to sell. But bad seller reviews for all to see and being 2K more than the play store with 2 weeks of shipping does not make it worthwhile for me. <br /> <br /> Nonetheless a brilliant phone and at an awesome price with amazing software(*Disclaimer: info I get from other reviews.).<br /> <br /> If this phone is as good they say it is then step aside Samsung, Sony, HTC. Google and LG have made this a beast for steal.<br /> <br /> 5 stars for the device though </span>

-----------------------Reviews --------<span class="review-text"> Hi friends,<br /> <br /> My info should help you decide making the right choice.!<br /> <br /> ?Cons:<br /> No in built FM<br /> 12(Actually 12.28) GB is all you to get to play around with your files and Data.<br /> No micro SD slot(Non-expandable storage)<br /> Loudspeaker is on the quiet side<br /> Non user-replaceable battery<br /> Comparatively less battery life<br /> Low Light Camera is 7.5/10<br /> <br /> ?Pros:<br /> 10/10 Most affordable phone with fastest Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset till the date.<br /> 10/10 &quot;Ok Google&quot; that is Google Now is much smarter now!!<br /> 10/10 First to get Google Android updates<br /> 10/10 Extremely fair Pricing<br /> 10/10 Excellent Display<br /> 10/10 Classy Design<br /> 8.5/10 Good call quality<br /> 9/10 Catches WIFI Signal even at relatively long distances<br /> 8/10 Battery Backup lasts for a around ~2 days<br /> 8.5/10 Music Quality<br /> 10/10 Hassle free stream of 1080p HD Movies<br /> 10/10 No lags on HD Games<br /> 9/10 Voice dialing works without internet/data and understands neutral Indian Accents flawlessly<br /> 9/10 Camera with optical image stabilization also Photo Spehere (360 degrees photo-shot) and 180 degrees Panorama shot very decent<br /> 8.5/10 USB host support, USB on-the-go support this time (Third party apps can give full support)<br /> <br /> So overall this is really Beast phone that if you want to purchase the Best phone in this budget then this is the only choice I think!<br /> You don't need a film star to promote this phone.<br /> People who use it will recommend this to their friends and family.! </span>
<span class="review-text"> I had ordered this phone via COD. All of a sudden without any notice they cancelled the order by saying that the confirmation call was failed as the price increased than the ordered price. I didn't receive any call for the confirmation and when i contacted them, they just said we're sorry!<br /> This is cheating from flipkart and i need justice for this! </span>
<span class="review-text"> I didn't buy this on fipkart as it was not available then , i am writing this review after using the phone for 10 days. I have also got the kitkat update 4.4.2 . <br /> <br /> pros :<br /> <br /> a). The processor is a beast. it handles anything very smoothly , without a single lag.<br /> b). the screen is awesome. you would love to watch movies &amp; pictures in this phone. the 4.95 inch screen full hd screen with 445 ppi is the best you can have.<br /> c). adreno 330 gpu does amazing work in handling all the graphics<br /> d). 2gb ram <br /> e) kitkat gives a wonderful android experience<br /> f) camera is good , may not be the best in low lighting otherwise good, specially after the update . The HDR+ feature works very nicely.<br /> g) if you love gaming , then you will love the phone .<br /> h) reading news &amp; magazines feels great in this phone due to the large screen with high resolution. <br /> i) it is very light . back panel gives a nice grip.<br /> <br /> cons <br /> <br /> a) the major con is the battery. it has a battery of 2300 mah , which is normally good. but this phone has a 5inch screen with full HD, so the sreen drains a lot of battery. nexus 4 had 2100 mah battery. Nexus 5 should have a maor jump in battery. LG G2 has a 3000 mah battery which has the same processor &amp; a 5.2 inch screen. Something like that would have been better. But it still manages to give backup for nearly a day.<br /> b) auto brightness of the phone works too well. it gives you more brightness than required , eventually draining your battery<br /> c) the speaker sound is very clear but a bit low. could have been better.<br /> d) auto rotation feature of screen sometimes doesn't work that well, it is very rare though.<br /> <br /> TIPS for saving battery<br /> <br /> 1) switch off wifi scanning(this is a feature to scan for wifi even if the the wifi is off)<br /> 2) don't use auto brightness , use manual instead<br /> 3) switch to 3G/2G if you are not using LTE network<br /> 4) turn on locations(GPS) only when required.<br /> <br /> I would suggest to buy this phone as it is a great deal at this price. I would give it a 5 star only if they would have given a more powerful battery </span>
<span class="review-text"> i have being using this phone for a month now.. and i must say i just love it..<br /> it can process anything in not in a second but in millisecond<br /> <br /> screen is awesome, with a very crisp display with 441ppi<br /> with adreno 330 gpu the gaming experience is top class..<br /> <br /> with the barometer support phone gives the location accurate by a metre and makes navigation easy.<br /> <br /> charging time is good, it can get fully charged in about 2 hours using standard travel charger, never tried wireless charging though<br /> <br /> and the headphones are pretty good and can hear it clearly even during travelling in a bus or train.. the loudspeakers are also loud enough with about 68db<br /> <br /> WiFi signal locking on pretty good, it can catch on the signal at 30-40 ft from router.<br /> the tethering speed on all modes (USB,WiFi,Bluetooth) is pretty fast<br /> <br /> if any calls from unknown number is received it shows the location of number searching from Google instantaneously..at-least you can guess who it might be..that is a pretty nice feature.. don't know if it is available in other phones<br /> <br /> slimport support is far more better than MHL. you dont need an additional power cable like in the case of MHL.. you just need to plug in an go..<br /> <br /> google voice search is correct most of the time and i am enjoying this feature..<br /> <br /> only downside is the battery. it last only for about 12 hours. it is mainly due to powerfull screen..<br /> camera options are less.nevertheless you can download the camera app from google play store<br /> <br /> thats it for now. will let you know more later.. </span>
<span class="review-text"> I don't know if there is a problem with batch of Nexus 5 smartphones that WS Retail has or I am unlucky to receive a faulty device twice !!<br /> Nexus 5 is a fabulous device except for the fact that there are serious call quality issues with it.<br /> Sometimes I don't hear the other person's voice sometimes the other person is not able to hear me clearly !! <br /> I ave also gone for a replacement of the device. Still the problem exists. I have even tried all the troubleshooting steps including reset the phone and booting into safe and have even changed the SIM ( tried of a diff network just to check if there is an issue with my network) !!<br /> Still things are the same !!! This is really frustating !!<br /> Probably will go for another replacement !! </span>
<span class="review-text"> Been using this fone for a month now...i must say i'm really satisfied with. I like it..its really fast..actually buttery smooth, no lag whatsoever..i like everything about the fone..be its screen , display, touch, processor...i downloaded some heavy games like iron man3 fifa14 asphalt 8 and it played them really well..its gaming graphics are best..and in the middle of the game if u press home it loads in nanoseconds..no wait or lag at all unlike other fones....it has stock android 4.4.2..no unnecessary apps..you can download any damn app from play store...i liked that notification toggles in Samsung fones in which u can turn WiFi Bluetooth data connection on and off...that thing was missing in my nexus but i found a app for that also on play store...its display is good also..very bright n gives true colors...i also liked its corning gorilla glass 3 screen..used it fora month so far and i don't have a single scratch on it..though i keep it carefully all the time...<br /> The only thing that disappoints me about this fone is its average camera..fone in this budget deserves a better camera...i'm not saying camera is bad..bt it js gives average shots..and you have to make required settings manually to get a good shot...plus battery is just average...<br /> Pros: Display ...............................10/10<br /> Processor ...........................10/10<br /> RAM....................................10/10<br /> Design/Looks/Weight/Slim.....10/10<br /> <br /> Cons: Camera................................7/10<br /> Battery.................................7/10<br /> Sound Quality.......................8/10 (lacks lil bass)<br /> Sound Loudness....................7/10 (if you are in noisy environment sound loudness gets dull)<br /> <br /> This fones compares with Samsung's S4..HTC's One..Sony's Z1..Apple's Iphone 5s....With alot of personal research, among all these fones i went for Nexus5 and i'm happy with my decision..... <br /> <br /> I was afraid to buy 30k fone from flipkart, was worried about its genuinity n other things but kudos to flipkart...im 100% satisfied with product!!<br /> <br /> This fones feels delicate..so slim n light weight that i had a feeling if i'll drop it, it will break badly so i bought cruzerlite back cover now my fone feels rock hard....just saying.. </span>
<span class="review-text"> coming soon doesn't mean tomorrow or day after tomorrow..nexus 7(2013) is coming soon for the past 2 months..you have to pay extra because its not launched yet in india..so please stop bitching and giving bad reviews..take or leave it..sonebody is atleast trying to sell something which is not yet available..appreciate it!!!! PEACE </span>
<span class="review-text"> I agree that the technical specs of the product and great, pricewise I am not sure if 30K is cheap as what every one feels is really cheap.<br /> <br /> But anyways, my biggest concern with this device is call quality. If you read on the net, you will find enough issues and google doesn't seem to know/have any clue on the fix. What I have faced:<br /> 1. People whom I call say they hear hissing noise, words get broken/go missing<br /> 2. Can't hear or the voice feels muffled.<br /> 3. This happens especially when you are connected via headset provided with the device or while connected through the incar BT audio (like in Figo)<br /> 4. I have tried Samsung S4 headset and even those seem to have same problems with this device<br /> <br /> I complained and google did replace the device with a new one, but unfortunately the problems are not gone. I have been using a Nokia N8, S4 and iPhone and have never faced these issues. The calls I make have been on the same locality, so we can rule out signal issues. <br /> <br /> So if you are planning to buy this device paying 30K, keep in mind these call related issues. I would suggest you read the other writeups on the net and you will know this is not a one off case and there are generic call related issues with this device. <br /> <br /> So a great phone with best specs but cannot make good quality phone calls. BTW, google offers refund policy in USA but not in India. </span>
<span class="review-text"> Have been Using this phone for more than a Week Now, must say I am very impressed with it.The processor is Super fast and the 2GB RAM makes sure, apps never Lag no matter what. The touch is one of the best in a smartphone. Android Kitkat is simply awesome, very smooth UI and Nexus will b always first to get the Updates, what more can you ask for?<br /> The Display is FULL HD (445 ppi), the clarity is simply superb. The battery lasts about a Day with Moderate usage, but with heavy usage will last for about 12-15 Hours. All in all, you can't ask for a better phone under 30k. Did I also mention how light the phone is? It's so light that u don't even feel it in you hands! <br /> If your Budget is 30k, go get this phone, don't even think twice! </span>
<span class="review-text"> hi,<br /> i have been facing some problems with the nexus.its been 2 months now and initially i thought it could be the network but its not.the problem is that there is a lot of call drops all the time,a call doesnot go at the 1st dial.mostly have to dial again.the touch screen doesnt respond at times...kindly help... </span>

-----------------------Reviews --------<span class="review-text"> Bought this phone on 20th Nov from a LG store in Indira Nagar. This is my first ever smart phone and I am very happy that I made a right decision.<br /> <br /> Pros:<br /> The moment you see the phone right out of the box, i will bet, you will LOVE it. It has a perfect design with matte rear finish. The bezels are smooth on either side and the phone can be handled in one hand easily. <br /> <br /> You will be surprised to see the weightlessness in your hand with the phone.<br /> <br /> The display was gorgeous with bright colors and is good for out door viewing as well. With Snapdragon 800 and 2 GB RAM, the phone is scarily fast. <br /> <br /> The camera is pretty good for daily in door and out door shots and I found nothing to crib about the functionality of the camera. Unless you are looking for a SLR quality, the phone does not disappoint in anyway. (I did not video record anything to check the video recording capability)<br /> <br /> Cons:<br /> As mentioned in almost all reviews for this phone, the battery drains out in one day. It has to be charged every night for a fresh start the next morning. But it can handle anything that comes up its way in a busy day of browsing, phone calls, games and videos.<br /> <br /> Finally, for a phone price in this range, the best specs are on board and the phone performs as expected. </span>
<span class="review-text"> Loving the phone, everything is good about it, not going to waste your time reviewing the phone. <br /> The delivery time of flipkart was satisfactory, but the product I received had a faulty display - The whites looked yellowish and I had to get it replaced and to my disappointment the second piece had a good display but the front camera was defective and not aligned. Poor quality, maybe reviews stating flipkart buys refurbished/defective products for cheap from companies is true. <br /> <br /> Rating 2 cause of the quality of products. </span>
<span class="review-text"> What is the first thing you want when you buy a phone? To be able to speak to someone through a call and this is where the nexus 5 fails. There is a voice defect affecting a lot of nexus 5 handsets and the person on the other side of the phone can't hear you. I bought my nexus 5 through google play and there customer support has promptly acknowledged the problem but refused to issue a refund or replacement.<br /> <br /> This is there response to the emails I sent to them<br /> <br /> Hello Vikas,<br /> <br /> Thank you for your reply.<br /> <br /> I've been able to replicate the issue on our side, and I've contacted our internal experts for further investigation. This seems to be a technical glitch, which would be rectified in the future software update.<br /> <br /> However, I wouldn't be able to comment on the exact date of its release. Once the update is released, Nexus devices would be on priority to receive the update.<br /> <br /> Your patience and understanding is appreciated.<br /> <br /> -------<br /> <br /> Hello Vikas,<br /> <br /> Thank you for your reply.<br /> As much as I wish to assist you in this regards, I'm sorry to inform you that I would not be able to issue a refund for the device.<br /> <br /> I would request you to wait for the next software update.<br /> <br /> Hope you understand!<br /> <br /> ----- </span>
<span class="review-text"> google is delivering nexus 5 in 1-2 business days and at 1K less to boot. i dont know who would buy from flipkart.<br /> though i would like to point out flipkart is a great service n i use it regularly. </span>
<span class="review-text"> No doubt this phone has lucious body, great resolutions and speed but has serious problem with the most basic features. It suffers with horrible microphone quality along with other software glitches. I had such bad experience with this phone that i had to claim refund from flipkart.<br /> <br /> Issues: 1. When I picked up any call, caller was not able to hear me for 1st 2-3 seconds.<br /> 2. Sometimes callers were complaining that I sound as I am talking from a long distance. This is an epic problem with Nexus 5. Google a bit to know more.<br /> 3.Record video in a silent place and watch that video to know the hissing sound which goes even worse when records a voice.<br /> <br /> These problems were not there when I used headphones.<br /> <br /> Other issue: 1. When i got call waiting and tried to pick up the second call...phone hangs and caller hears continuous ringing. This happens randomly.<br /> 2. During long hour calls..phone heats up and restarts automatically.<br /> 3. Mobile data does not connect unless phone is restarted once. <br /> <br /> Google has improved some of the bugs with update 4.4.2 but I don't know why they are ignoring microphone issues. If this persists, I am sure success of this phone won't last long. </span>
<span class="review-text"> play store price at 28,999 /- so whats the use buying from flipkart...costing 1k more....................................... </span>
<span class="review-text"> I don't know why people cannot wait for some more time- lot of options available<br /> <br /> Xiomi MI4 , One+One , Nexux 6 , Moto X1... Are upcoming smart phones which are best value for money after september 2014.<br /> <br /> Nexus 5 Pricing is bit high- Price should have been 20K.<br /> <br /> And also people are running behind MI3 where Mi4 is already released in China!!<br /> MI3 is not the Best. <br /> <br /> UPDATED <br /> NOTE: ALL THE EXISTING PHONES WILL BE OUTDATED IN ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AND NEW TREND OF 64 BIT PROCESSOR &amp; ANDROID L WILL START. </span>
<span class="review-text"> Why Flipkart shows MircoSD cards in supported acessories with Nexus 5 , and in combo offer Samsung MicroSD card . Why would anybody want a MIcroSD card when Nexus does not support MIrcoSD. </span>
<span class="review-text"> I got Nexus 5 the beast at price 1K less without taxes and/delivery charges from Play Store within 48hrs of placing the order. </span>
<span class="review-text"> Nexus 5 is a true Beast which offers a very clean and high-performance android 4.4 experience. Having said that this is the first device to be running android 4.4, I must add that this is not only the first but also the best device you will get for a price range of 30k running Android Kitkat. The Hardware delivers smooth performance not just on Reviews, or Hands-Ons but in real time as well. This is a definitely thumbs up phone to go for. </span>

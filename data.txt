-----------------------Reviews --------<span class="review-text"> Eagerly Waiting! Looking to buy a new phone....Which is better: Nokia Lumia 925 OR The 5. Battery remains the concern in both the phones but camera good in case of Lumia. let's wait </span>
<span class="review-text"> Been using this mobile from last week,no words to say,amazing phone, only con about this device is the camera,its not that great </span>
<span class="review-text"> I received this phone yesterday from Google play store. <br /> I noticed two issues as of now- <br /> 1. The charger makes a buzzing sound which is very annoying. Then I plugged the USB cable with my IPad mini charger and no sound. So, the charger that comes with N5 has issue. <br /> 2. Vibration motor makes a annoying sound too. For example when you press keys.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </span>
<span class="review-text"> one of the best phones in the market.<br /> At this price range it is the best phone with all the android updates first to this phone.<br /> if u r an android fan and love customization .GO for it.<br /> I have no regret purchasing this phone.<br /> The best machine till date from GOOGLE.<br /> If your budget is 30000 go for it.<br /> Fits perfectly in all aspects-&gt;PERFORMANCE,GAMING,CAMERA,SCREEN SIZE,DISPLAY and after all its a nexus device ..GO FOR IT. </span>

<span class="review-text"> Hi all i poses this phone from 25th Nov'13, 3 days after the launch in India. i am writing this review after complete 3 months of use.<br /> 1) Got updates 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 within 1 week of use.. fixing all the bugs of kitkat.<br /> 2) Pure Android performance.<br /> 3) on 2g and normal cell battery survives 2 days(48 hours), 72 hours when with no internet and only normal calling.<br /> 4) Out of 2 gb ram 1gb ram is always in use... Google services keep using that.. so u have 1 gb for other purpose..after clearing ram from clean master(android app) the ram consumed is 47%.<br /> 5) As all phone slow down after usage.. as many apps are downloaded, compared to new phone, Nexus 5 will also. no lag in touch, only lag in start up of heavy apps like subway surfer and temple run.<br /> <br /> Till now no new phone has been launched after it to its competition. so Enjoy nexus experience. </span>
<span class="review-text"> Guys I am using this phone since 2 weeks and it is just awesome. Probably the best touch you will get on any android phone. It has the stock android 4.4 means you will be the first to get the latest updates. The stock android android works smoothly. Well the camera is little slow to capture your favorite shot but the update is going to fix that soon. Some people may find the speaker annoying but hey..its an teardown version of LG G2 which is probably the best smartphone in the market. If you are a heavy mobile user than the battery will last till the evening. Other than that its a perfect smartphone. <br /> I am lovin it ;) </span>
<span class="review-text"> Undoubtedly the best 'thing' that Rs. 29990 can buy. And powerful enough to beat Note 3, Xperia Z1, LG G2, and of course iPhone 5S. </span>
<span class="review-text"> i dont own this phone to be true but atleast reading its specs and watching videos on youtube i can say definitely the best branded phone with such specs i mean 2.3 ghz quaz core!!! +full hd display +2gb ram+adreno 330 gpu (nena mark=approx 58 which is very good for 1080p display gaming )nfc+wireless charging +4g +4.4 kitkat .yes i know micromax ,gionee ,etc rebranded companies have full hd and all around 20k but come on guys this is google/lg we are talking about here you simply cant compare between the quality of hardware these two offer !!! <br /> so if u are willing to spend 30k on a android mobile then close your guys and purchase this future smooth fast future proof phone </span>
<span class="review-text"> lovely phone iam using it since 3 days.. checked throughly..<br /> lovely phone.. a must buy if your range is 30K<br /> <br /> no issues at all. kitkat looks and feels kool.. tho hangout view of sms is kinda irritating.<br /> <br /> lovely battery and benchmark tests.<br /> <br /> go fr it </span>

-----------------------Reviews --------<span class="review-text"> actually waiting for 32gb version best ever in the world i hve a sample piece of this mob and it is too good <br /> <br /> but it is too sensitive it can break into pieces mainly the front screen <br /> so u need to buy a nice case for tht <br /> etc etc things are best<br /> <br /> and if competition for this is absoulutely xperia z1 can afford any one of them </span>
<span class="review-text"> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world <br /> NEXUS 5 is BEST PHONE in the world </span>
<span class="review-text"> 2 stars for obtaining the phone to sell. But bad seller reviews for all to see and being 2K more than the play store with 2 weeks of shipping does not make it worthwhile for me. <br /> <br /> Nonetheless a brilliant phone and at an awesome price with amazing software(*Disclaimer: info I get from other reviews.).<br /> <br /> If this phone is as good they say it is then step aside Samsung, Sony, HTC. Google and LG have made this a beast for steal.<br /> <br /> 5 stars for the device though </span>
